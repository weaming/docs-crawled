<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to control
a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.  It was inspired
by the following:</p>
<p>Convenience</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It is often inconvenient to need to write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rc.d</span></code> scripts for every
single process instance.  <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rc.d</span></code> scripts are a great
lowest-common-denominator form of process
initialization/autostart/management, but they can be painful to
write and maintain.  Additionally, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rc.d</span></code> scripts cannot
automatically restart a crashed process and many programs do not
restart themselves properly on a crash.  Supervisord starts
processes as its subprocesses, and can be configured to
automatically restart them on a crash.  It can also automatically be
configured to start processes on its own invocation.</div></blockquote>
<p>Accuracy</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It&#8217;s often difficult to get accurate up/down status on processes on
UNIX.  Pidfiles often lie.  Supervisord starts processes as
subprocesses, so it always knows the true up/down status of its
children and can be queried conveniently for this data.</div></blockquote>
<p>Delegation</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Users who need to control process state often need only to do that.
They don&#8217;t want or need full-blown shell access to the machine on
which the processes are running.  Processes which listen on &#8220;low&#8221;
TCP ports often need to be started and restarted as the root user (a
UNIX misfeature).  It&#8217;s usually the case that it&#8217;s perfectly fine to
allow &#8220;normal&#8221; people to stop or restart such a process, but
providing them with shell access is often impractical, and providing
them with root access or sudo access is often impossible.  It&#8217;s also
(rightly) difficult to explain to them why this problem exists.  If
supervisord is started as root, it is possible to allow &#8220;normal&#8221;
users to control such processes without needing to explain the
intricacies of the problem to them.  Supervisorctl allows a very
limited form of access to the machine, essentially allowing users to
see process status and control supervisord-controlled subprocesses
by emitting &#8220;stop&#8221;, &#8220;start&#8221;, and &#8220;restart&#8221; commands from a simple
shell or web UI.</div></blockquote>
<p>Process Groups</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Processes often need to be started and stopped in groups, sometimes
even in a &#8220;priority order&#8221;.  It&#8217;s often difficult to explain to
people how to do this.  Supervisor allows you to assign priorities
to processes, and allows user to emit commands via the supervisorctl
client like &#8220;start all&#8221;, and &#8220;restart all&#8221;, which starts them in the
preassigned priority order.  Additionally, processes can be grouped
into &#8220;process groups&#8221; and a set of logically related processes can
be stopped and started as a unit.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Simple</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Supervisor is configured through a simple INI-style config file
that’s easy to learn. It provides many per-process options that make
your life easier like restarting failed processes and automatic log
rotation.</div></blockquote>
<p>Centralized</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Supervisor provides you with one place to start, stop, and monitor
your processes. Processes can be controlled individually or in
groups. You can configure Supervisor to provide a local or remote
command line and web interface.</div></blockquote>
<p>Efficient</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Supervisor starts its subprocesses via fork/exec and subprocesses
don’t daemonize. The operating system signals Supervisor immediately
when a process terminates, unlike some solutions that rely on
troublesome PID files and periodic polling to restart failed
processes.</div></blockquote>
<p>Extensible</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Supervisor has a simple event notification protocol that programs
written in any language can use to monitor it, and an XML-RPC
interface for control. It is also built with extension points that
can be leveraged by Python developers.</div></blockquote>
<p>Compatible</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Supervisor works on just about everything except for Windows. It is
tested and supported on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and FreeBSD. It is
written entirely in Python, so installation does not require a C
compiler.</div></blockquote>
<p>Proven</p>
<blockquote>
<div>While Supervisor is very actively developed today, it is not new
software. Supervisor has been around for years and is already in use
on many servers.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supervisor-components">
<h2>Supervisor Components<a class="headerlink" href="#supervisor-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong class="program">supervisord</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The server piece of supervisor is named <strong class="program">supervisord</strong>.  It
is responsible for starting child programs at its own invocation,
responding to commands from clients, restarting crashed or exited
subprocesseses, logging its subprocess <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stdout</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stderr</span></code>
output, and generating and handling &#8220;events&#8221; corresponding to points
in subprocess lifetimes.</p>
<p>The server process uses a configuration file.  This is typically
located in <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/supervisord.conf</span></code>.  This configuration file
is a &#8220;Windows-INI&#8221; style config file.  It is important to keep this
file secure via proper filesystem permissions because it may contain
unencrypted usernames and passwords.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong class="program">supervisorctl</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The command-line client piece of the supervisor is named
<strong class="program">supervisorctl</strong>.  It provides a shell-like interface to the
features provided by <strong class="program">supervisord</strong>.  From
<strong class="program">supervisorctl</strong>, a user can connect to different
<strong class="program">supervisord</strong> processes, get status on the subprocesses
controlled by, stop and start subprocesses of, and get lists of
running processes of a <strong class="program">supervisord</strong>.</p>
<p>The command-line client talks to the server across a UNIX domain
socket or an internet (TCP) socket.  The server can assert that the
user of a client should present authentication credentials before it
allows him to perform commands.  The client process typically uses
the same configuration file as the server but any configuration file
with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[supervisorctl]</span></code> section in it will work.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Web Server</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A (sparse) web user interface with functionality comparable to
<strong class="program">supervisorctl</strong> may be accessed via a browser if you start
<strong class="program">supervisord</strong> against an internet socket.  Visit the server
URL (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://localhost:9001/</span></code>) to view and control process
status through the web interface after activating the configuration
file&#8217;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[inet_http_server]</span></code> section.</div></blockquote>
<p>XML-RPC Interface</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The same HTTP server which serves the web UI serves up an XML-RPC
interface that can be used to interrogate and control supervisor and
the programs it runs.  See <a class="reference internal" href="api.html#xml-rpc"><span>XML-RPC API Documentation</span></a>.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-requirements">
<h2>Platform Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supervisor has been tested and is known to run on Linux (Ubuntu 9.10),
Mac OS X (10.4/10.5/10.6), and Solaris (10 for Intel) and FreeBSD 6.1.
It will likely work fine on most UNIX systems.</p>
<p>Supervisor will <em>not</em> run at all under any version of Windows.</p>
<p>Supervisor works under Python 2 version 2.6 or greater and Python 3 version 3.2 or greater.</p>
