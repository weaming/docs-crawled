          libcurl not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Winssl
          ==========================================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, March 26th 2014
<a href="security.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html</a>
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  When asked to do a TLS connection (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, etc) to a URL
  specified with an IP address instead of a name, libcurl would wrongly not
  verify the server's name in the certificate. The signature (whether it was
  signed by a trusted CA) and validity (whether the date was within the
  certificate's lifetime and it was not revoked) verifications were still
  performed.
&nbsp;
  This is a problem in libcurl built to use the SChannel/Winssl TLS backend.
  SChannel/Winssl is the native library provided by Microsoft Windows.
&nbsp;
  Only users on Windows can be affected by this. And only if libcurl was built
  to use the native TLS backend library.
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2014-2522 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  This flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support the
  SChannel/Winssl backend.
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.27.0 to and including 7.35.0
  Not affected versions: libcurl &gt;= 7.36.0
&nbsp;
  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.36.0 makes sure that all TLS using requests verify the host name
  even if specified as an IP address in the URL.
&nbsp;
  A patch for this problem is available at:
&nbsp;
    <a href="https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/63fc8ee7be2b71">https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/63fc8ee7be2b71</a>
&nbsp;
  The fix was committed to the public source code repository because the full
  security impact wasn't properly realized until after the fact.
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.36.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
  C - Rebuild libcurl to use another TLS backend
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  It was discovered by the curl project during late February 2014.
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.36.0 was released on March 26th 2014, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
&nbsp;
6. CREDITS
&nbsp;
  David Ryskalczyk made us aware of this flaw and wrote the patch.
&nbsp;
  Marc Hoersken helped coordinate the bug fix.
&nbsp;
  Thanks a lot!
