                        curl SSL CBC IV vulnerability
                        =============================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, January 24th 2012
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  curl is vulnerable to a SSL CBC IV vulnerability when built to use OpenSSL
  for the SSL/TLS layer.
&nbsp;
  This vulernability has been identified (CVE-2011-3389) and is addressed by
  OpenSSL already as they have made a work-around to mitigate the problem.
  When doing so, they figured out that some servers didn't work with the
  work-around and offered a way to disable it.
&nbsp;
  The bit used to disable the workaround was then added to the generic
  SSL_OP_ALL bitmask that SSL clients may use to enable work-arounds for
  better compatibility with servers. libcurl uses the SSL_OP_ALL bitmask.
&nbsp;
  While SSL_OP_ALL is documented to enable "rather harmless" work-arounds, it
  does in this case effectively enable this security vulnerability again.
&nbsp;
  There is no known exploit for this problem.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  Only curl and libcurl builds that use OpenSSL are affected.
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: curl 7.10.6 to and including 7.23.1
  Not affected versions: curl &lt; 7.10.6 and &gt;= 7.24.0
&nbsp;
  Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
  advertised as such.
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.24.0 never sets the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.24.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
      http://curl.haxx.se/curl-dont-insert-empty-fragments.patch
&nbsp;
  C - Rebuild curl with another SSL library
&nbsp;
  D - Change the option within your application by using the
      CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION callback
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  product-security at Apple reported this problem to us on January 19th 2012.
&nbsp;
  We discussed solutions and a first patch was written on the same day.
&nbsp;
  curl 7.24.0 was released on January 24th 2012, coordinated with the
  publication of this this flaw.
