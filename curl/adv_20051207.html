                  libcurl URL Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
                  =========================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, December 7th 2005
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
libcurl's URL parser function can overflow a malloced buffer in two ways, if
given a too long URL.
&nbsp;
These overflows happen if you
&nbsp;
 1 - pass in a URL with no protocol (like "http://") prefix, using no slash
     and the string is 256 bytes or longer. This leads to a single zero byte
     overflow of the malloced buffer.
&nbsp;
 2 - pass in a URL with only a question mark as separator (no slash) between
     the host and the query part of the URL. This leads to a single zero byte
     overflow of the malloced buffer.
&nbsp;
Both overflows can be made with the same input string, leading to two single
zero byte overwrites.
&nbsp;
The affected flaw cannot be triggered by a redirect, but the long URL must be
passed in "directly" to libcurl. It makes this a "local" problem. Of course,
lots of programs may still pass in user-provided URLs to libcurl without doing
much syntax checking of their own, allowing a user to exploit this
vulnerability.
&nbsp;
There is no known exploit at the time of this writing.
&nbsp;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2005-4077 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.11.2 to and including 7.15.0
Not affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.11.1 and earlier, 7.15.1 and later
&nbsp;
Also note that (lib)curl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.
&nbsp;
3. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately:
&nbsp;
 I - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.15.1
&nbsp;
 II - Apply the patch http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-urllen.patch to your
      libcurl version and install this
&nbsp;
 III - Make sure the URLs you pass to libcurl always have a protocol part
       prepended
&nbsp;
4. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
We were notified by Stefan Esser on November 29th, 2005.
&nbsp;
Discussions were held and the patch to fix this flaw was made swiftly.
&nbsp;
[Dec 12 2005] Additional info on what's required for 7.14.0 and earlier was
provided by Wilfried Weissmann in a Redhat bug report. The provided patch
above was updated and adjusted to the newly discovered facts.
&nbsp;
