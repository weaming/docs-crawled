                           curl local file overwrite
                           =========================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, October 13th 2010
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  curl offers a command line option --remote-header-name (also usable as -J)
  which will use the file name of the Content-disposition: header when it
  saves the downloaded data locally.
&nbsp;
  curl attempts to cut off the directory parts from any given file name in the
  header to only store files in the current directory. It will overwrite a
  local file using the same name as the header specifies.
&nbsp;
  The stripping of the directory did not take backslashes into account. On
  some operating systems, backslashes are used to separate directories and
  file names. This allows a rogue server to send back a response that
  overwrites a file name in the local machine that the user is allowed to
  write, potentially a system file, a command or a known executable.
&nbsp;
  Operating systems affected include Windows, Netware, MSDOS, OS/2 and
  Symbian.
&nbsp;
  This error is only present in the curl command line tool, it is NOT a
  problem of the library libcurl.
&nbsp;
  There is no known exploit for this problem.
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2010-3842 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: curl 7.20.0 to and including 7.21.1
  Not affected versions: curl &lt; 7.20.0 and &gt;= 7.21.2
&nbsp;
  Also note that curl is used by many applications, and not always advertised
  as such.
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.21.2 makes sure that it will also strip off paths specified using
  backslashes as path separator.
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.21.2
&nbsp;
  B - Apply this patch and rebuild
&nbsp;
      http://curl.haxx.se/curl-content-disposition.patch
&nbsp;
  C - Stop using the --remote-header-name/-J option
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  Dan Fandrich realized the problem exists and reported to the rest of the
  team on September 3 2010.
&nbsp;
  We discussed solutions and a first patch was written and tested on September
  4th.
&nbsp;
  curl 7.21.2 was released on October 13th 2010, just before this flaw was
  publicly disclosed.
&nbsp;
6. CREDITS
&nbsp;
  Reported to us by Dan Fandrich. Thanks a lot!
