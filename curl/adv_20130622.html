                   libcurl URL decode buffer boundary flaw
                   =======================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, June 22nd 2013
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  libcurl is vulnerable to a case of bad checking of the input data which may
  lead to heap corruption.
&nbsp;
  The function curl_easy_unescape() decodes URL encoded strings to raw binary
  data. URL encoded octets are represented with %HH combinations where HH is a
  two-digit hexadecimal number. The decoded string is written to an allocated
  memory area that the function returns to the caller.
&nbsp;
  The function takes a source string and a length parameter, and if the length
  provided is 0 the function will instead use strlen() to figure out how much
  data to parse.
&nbsp;
  The "%HH" parser wrongly only considered the case where a zero byte would
  terminate the input. If a length-limited buffer was passed in which ended
  with a '%' character which was followed by two hexadecimal digits outside of
  the buffer libcurl was allowed to parse alas without a terminating zero,
  libcurl would still parse that sequence as well. The counter for remaining
  data to handle would then be decreased too much and wrap to become a very
  large integer and the copying would go on too long and the destination
  buffer that is allocated on the heap would get overwritten.
&nbsp;
  We consider it unlikely that programs allow user-provided strings unfiltered
  into this function. Also, only the not zero-terminated input string use case
  is affected by this flaw. Exploiting this flaw for gain is probably possible
  for specific circumstances but we consider the general risk for this to be
  low.
&nbsp;
  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it doesn't use
  this function.
&nbsp;
  There are no known exploits available at this time.
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-2174 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.7 to and including 7.30.0
  Not affected versions: libcurl before 7.7 and &gt;= 7.31.0
&nbsp;
  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.31.0 implements a proper check that the following hexdigits are
  within the provided input length.
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.31.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
      http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-unescape.patch
&nbsp;
  C - Double-check your curl_easy_unescape() usage (for example use it with
      the 'length' argument set to 0), or avoid using that function
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  Vulnerability found by Timo Sirainen. Patched by Daniel Stenberg.
&nbsp;
  It was reported to the curl project on May 19th 2013. We contacted
  linux-distros on June 12th.
&nbsp;
  curl 7.31.0 was released on June 22nd 2013, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
&nbsp;
6. CREDITS
&nbsp;
  Reported by Timo Sirainen. Thanks a lot!
