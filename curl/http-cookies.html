 <h2>1. HTTP Cookies</h2><a name="Cookie_overview"></a><h3>1.1 Cookie overview</h3>
<p>  HTTP cookies are pieces of 'name=contents' snippets that a server tells the
   client to hold and then the client sends back those the server on subsequent
    requests to the same domains/paths for which the cookies were set.
 <p>  Cookies are either "session cookies" which typically are forgotten when the
   session is over which is often translated to equal when browser quits, or
    the cookies aren't session cookies they have expiration dates after which
    the client will throw them away.
 <p>  Cookies are set to the client with the Set-Cookie: header and are sent to
   servers with the Cookie: header.
 <p>  For a very long time, the only spec explaining how to use cookies was the
   original Netscape spec from 1994: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html">http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html</a>
 <p>  In 2011, RFC6265 (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt</a>) was finally published
   and details how cookies work within HTTP.
 <a name="Cookies_saved_to_disk"></a><h3>1.2 Cookies saved to disk</h3>
<p>  Netscape once created a file format for storing cookies on disk so that they
   would survive browser restarts. curl adopted that file format to allow
    sharing the cookies with browsers, only to see browsers move away from that
    format. Modern browsers no longer use it, while curl still does.
 <p>  The netscape cookie file format stores one cookie per physical line in the
   file with a bunch of associated meta data, each field separated with
    TAB. That file is called the cookiejar in curl terminology.
 <p>  When libcurl saves a cookiejar, it creates a file header of its own in which
   there is a URL mention that will link to the web version of this document.
 <a name="Cookies_with_curl_the_command_li"></a><h3>1.3 Cookies with curl the command line tool</h3>
<p>  curl has a full cookie "engine" built in. If you just activate it, you can
   have curl receive and send cookies exactly as mandated in the specs.
 <p>  Command line options:
<p>  -b, --cookie
<p>    tell curl a file to read cookies from and start the cookie engine, or if
     it isn't a file it will pass on the given string. -b name=var works and so
      does -b cookiefile.
 <p>  -j, --junk-session-cookies
<p>    when used in combination with -b, it will skip all "session cookies" on
     load so as to appear to start a new cookie session.
 <p>  -c, --cookie-jar
<p>    tell curl to start the cookie engine and write cookies to the given file
     after the request(s)
 <a name="Cookies_with_libcurl"></a><h3>1.4 Cookies with libcurl</h3>
<p>  libcurl offers several ways to enable and interface the cookie engine. These
   options are the ones provided by the native API. libcurl bindings may offer
    access to them using other means.
 <p>  CURLOPT_COOKIE
<p>    Is used when you want to specify the exact contents of a cookie header to
     send to the server.
 <p>  CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE
<p>    Tell libcurl to activate the cookie engine, and to read the initial set of
     cookies from the given file. Read-only.
 <p>  CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR
<p>    Tell libcurl to activate the cookie engine, and when the easy handle is
     closed save all known cookies to the given cookiejar file. Write-only.
 <p>  CURLOPT_COOKIELIST
<p>    Provide detailed information about a single cookie to add to the internal
     storage of cookies. Pass in the cookie as a HTTP header with all the
      details set, or pass in a line from a netscape cookie file. This option
      can also be used to flush the cookies etc.
 <p>  CURLINFO_COOKIELIST
<p>    Extract cookie information from the internal cookie storage as a linked
     list.
 <a name="Cookies_with_javascript"></a><h3>1.5 Cookies with javascript</h3>
<p>  These days a lot of the web is built up by javascript. The webbrowser loads
   complete programs that render the page you see. These javascript programs
    can also set and access cookies.
 <p>  Since curl and libcurl are plain HTTP clients without any knowledge of or
   capability to handle javascript, such cookies will not be detected or used.
 <p>  Often, if you want to mimic what a browser does on such web sites, you can
   record web browser HTTP traffic when using such a site and then repeat the
    cookie operations using curl or libcurl.
