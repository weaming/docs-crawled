              libcurl IP address wildcard certificate validation
              ==================================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, Match 26th 2014
<a href="security.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html</a>
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  libcurl incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal
  IP addresses.
&nbsp;
  RFC 2818 covers the requirements for matching Common Names (CNs) and
  subjectAltNames in order to establish valid SSL connections. It first
  discusses CNs that are for hostnames, and the rules for wildcards in this
  case. The next paragraph in the RFC then discusses CNs that are IP
  addresses:
&nbsp;
  'In some cases, the URI is specified as an IP address rather than a
  hostname. In this case, the iPAddress subjectAltName must be present in the
  certificate and must exactly match the IP in the URI.'
&nbsp;
  The intention of the RFC is clear in that you should not be able to use
  wildcards with IP addresses (in order to avoid the ability to perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks). Unfortunately libcurl fails to adhere to this
  rule under certain conditions, and subsequently it would allow and use a
  wildcard match specified in the CN field.
&nbsp;
  Exploiting this flaw, a malicious server could participate in a MITM attack
  or just easier fool users that it is a legitimate site for whatever purpose,
  when it actually isn't.
&nbsp;
  A good CA should refuse to issue a certificate with the CN as indicated,
  however there only need be one CA to issue one in error for this issue to
  result in the user getting no warning at all and being vulnerable to MITM.
&nbsp;
  This flaw is only present in libcurl when built to use one out of a few
  specific TLS libraries: OpenSSL, axtls, qsossl or gskit.
&nbsp;
  This problem is similar to the one previously reported by Richard Moore,
  found in multiple browsers [1].
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2014-0139 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  This flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support SSL or TLS with
  OpenSSL
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.35.0
  Not affected versions: libcurl &gt;= 7.36.0
&nbsp;
  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.36.0 has an improved host name verification function that rejects
  wild card matching against IP addresses.
&nbsp;
  A patch for this problem is available at:
&nbsp;
    <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-reject-cert-ip-wildcards.patch">http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-reject-cert-ip-wildcards.patch</a>
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.36.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
  C - Build libcurl to use a different TLS backend
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  It was reported to the curl project on February 22nd 2014. We contacted
  distros@openwall on March 16th 2014.
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.36.0 was released on March 26th 2014, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
&nbsp;
