                  libcurl SASL buffer overflow vulnerability
                  ==========================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, February 6th 2013
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  libcurl is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability when communicating
  with one of the protocols POP3, SMTP or IMAP.
&nbsp;
  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the server
  without doing the proper length checks and that data is then appended to a
  local fixed-size buffer on the stack.
&nbsp;
  This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a server
  that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or IMAP. For
  applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also thinkable that a
  malicious user would feed an application with a URL to a server hosting code
  targetting this flaw.
&nbsp;
  This vulnerability can be used for remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable
  systems.
&nbsp;
  Both curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl library
  are vulnerable.
&nbsp;
  There is no known exploit for this problem.
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-0249 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: curl 7.26.0 to and including 7.28.1
  Not affected versions: curl &lt; 7.26.0 and &gt;= 7.29.0
&nbsp;
  Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
  advertised as such.
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.29.0 implements proper bounds checking and will not overflow any
  buffers even if unrealistically long data chunks are received.
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.29.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply this patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
      http://curl.haxx.se/curl-sasl.patch
&nbsp;
  C - Rebuild curl with support for vulnerable protocols IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
      disabled.
&nbsp;
  D - Disable the vulnerable protocols IMAP, POP3 and SMTP at run-time to
      forbid libcurl from using them. You can do this with the
      CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS option.
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  Vulnerability found and patched by Volema (http://volema.com/).
&nbsp;
  It was reported to the curl project on January 30th 2013.
&nbsp;
  curl 7.29.0 was released on February 6th 2013, coordinated with the
  publication of this flaw.
&nbsp;
6. CREDITS
&nbsp;
  Reported and fixed by Volema. Thanks a lot!
