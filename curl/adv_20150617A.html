<h1>lingering HTTP credentials in connection re-use</h1>
<p>Project cURL Security Advisory, June 17th 2015 -
<a href="adv_20150617A.html">Permalink</a></p>
<h2>VULNERABILITY</h2>
<p>libcurl can wrongly send HTTP credentials when re-using connections.</p>
<p>libcurl allows applications to set credentials for the upcoming transfer with
HTTP Basic authentication, like with <code>CURLOPT_USERPWD</code> for example. Name and
password. Just like all other libcurl options the credentials are sticky and
are kept associated with the "handle" until something is made to change the
situation.</p>
<p>Further, libcurl offers a <code>curl_easy_reset()</code> function that resets a handle
back to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A reset is of
course also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is typically used to
clear up the handle and prepare it for a new, possibly unrelated, transfer.</p>
<p>Within such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous connections in
case a second transfer is requested to a host name for which an existing
connection is already kept alive.</p>
<p>With this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make libcurl
accidentally use those credentials in a subseqent request if done to the same
host name and connection as was previously accessed.</p>
<p>An example case would be first requesting a password protected resource from
one section of a web site, and then do a second request of a public resource
from a completely different part of the site without authentication. This flaw
would then inadvertently leak the credentials in the second request.</p>
<p>We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.</p>
<h2>INFO</h2>
<p>This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation
series is made with that.</p>
<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2015-3236 to this issue.</p>
<h2>AFFECTED VERSIONS</h2>
<p>This flaw is relevant for</p>
<ul>
<li>Affected versions: libcurl 7.40.0 to and including 7.42.1</li>
<li>Not affected versions: libcurl &lt; 7.40.0 and libcurl >= 7.43.0</li>
</ul>
<p>libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!</p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>In version 7.43.0, libcurl properly clears the credentials and prevents them
from lingering around.</p>
<p>A patch for this problem that changes the default is available at (URL will be
updated in final advisory):</p>
<pre><code>http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3236.patch
</code></pre>
<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<p>We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:</p>
<p>A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.43.0</p>
<p>B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild</p>
<p>C - If you use <code>curl_easy_reset()</code>, explicitly set the credentials afterwards</p>
<h2>TIME LINE</h2>
<p>It was first reported to the curl project on May 19 2015. We contacted
distros@openwall on June 11.</p>
<p>libcurl 7.43.0 was released on June 17 2015, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.</p>
