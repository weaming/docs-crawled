 <h2>1. Philosophy</h2><a name="What_is_cURL"></a><h3>1.1 What is cURL?</h3>
<p>  cURL is the name of the project. The name is a play on 'Client for URLs',
   originally with URL spelled in uppercase to make it obvious it deals with
    URLs. The fact it can also be pronounced 'see URL' also helped, it works as
    an abbreviation for "Client URL Request Library" or why not the recursive
    version: "Curl URL Request Library".
 <p>  The cURL project produces two products:
<p>  libcurl
<p>    A free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library, supporting DICT,
     FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3,
      POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.
 <p>    libcurl supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading,
     Kerberos, SPNEGO, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
      authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunneling and more!
 <p>    libcurl is highly portable, it builds and works identically on numerous
     platforms, including Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HP-UX,
      IRIX, AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/2, BeOS, Mac
      OS X, Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS, Symbian, OSF,
      Android, Minix, IBM TPF and more...
 <p>    libcurl is free, thread-safe, IPv6 compatible, feature rich, well
     supported and fast.
 <p>  curl
<p>    A command line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax.
<p>    Since curl uses libcurl, curl supports the same wide range of common
     Internet protocols that libcurl does.
 <p>  We pronounce curl with an initial k sound. It rhymes with words like girl
   and earl. This is a short WAV file to help you:
 <pre>
 <a href="http://media.merriam-webster.com/soundc11/c/curl0001.wav">http://media.merriam-webster.com/soundc11/c/curl0001.wav</a>
</pre>
<p>  There are numerous sub-projects and related projects that also use the word
   curl in the project names in various combinations, but you should take
    notice that this FAQ is directed at the command-line tool named curl (and
    libcurl the library), and may therefore not be valid for other curl-related
    projects. (There is however a small section for the PHP/CURL in this FAQ.)
 <a name="What_is_libcurl"></a><h3>1.2 What is libcurl?</h3>
<p>  libcurl is a reliable and portable library which provides you with an easy
   interface to a range of common Internet protocols.
 <p>  You can use libcurl for free in your application, be it open source,
   commercial or closed-source.
 <p>  libcurl is most probably the most portable, most powerful and most often
   used C-based multi-platform file transfer library on this planet - be it
    open source or commercial.
 <a name="What_is_curl_not"></a><h3>1.3 What is curl not?</h3>
<p>  Curl is not a wget clone. That is a common misconception.  Never, during
   curl's development, have we intended curl to replace wget or compete on its
    market. Curl is targeted at single-shot file transfers.
 <p>  Curl is not a web site mirroring program. If you want to use curl to mirror
   something: fine, go ahead and write a script that wraps around curl to make
    it reality (like curlmirror.pl does).
 <p>  Curl is not an FTP site mirroring program. Sure, get and send FTP with curl
   but if you want systematic and sequential behavior you should write a
    script (or write a new program that interfaces libcurl) and do it.
 <p>  Curl is not a PHP tool, even though it works perfectly well when used from
   or with PHP (when using the PHP/CURL module).
 <p>  Curl is not a program for a single operating system. Curl exists, compiles,
   builds and runs under a wide range of operating systems, including all
    modern Unixes (and a bunch of older ones too), Windows, Amiga, BeOS, OS/2,
    OS X, QNX etc.
 <a name="When_will_you_make_curl_do_XXXX"></a><h3>1.4 When will you make curl do XXXX ?</h3>
<p>  We love suggestions of what to change in order to make curl and libcurl
   better. We do however believe in a few rules when it comes to the future of
    curl:
 <p>  Curl -- the command line tool -- is to remain a non-graphical command line
   tool. If you want GUIs or fancy scripting capabilities, you should look for
    another tool that uses libcurl.
 <p>  We do not add things to curl that other small and available tools already do
   very fine at the side. Curl's output is fine to pipe into another program or
    redirect to another file for the next program to interpret.
 <p>  We focus on protocol related issues and improvements. If you wanna do more
   magic with the supported protocols than curl currently does, chances are big
    we will agree. If you wanna add more protocols, we may very well agree.
 <p>  If you want someone else to make all the work while you wait for us to
   implement it for you, that is not a very friendly attitude. We spend a
    considerable time already on maintaining and developing curl. In order to
    get more out of us, you should consider trading in some of your time and
    efforts in return.
 <p>  If you write the code, chances are bigger that it will get into curl faster.
<a name="Who_makes_curl"></a><h3>1.5 Who makes curl?</h3>
<p>  curl and libcurl are not made by any single individual. Daniel Stenberg is
   project leader and main developer, but other persons' submissions are
    important and crucial. Anyone can contribute and post their changes and
    improvements and have them inserted in the main sources (of course on the
    condition that developers agree on that the fixes are good).
 <p>  The full list of all contributors is found in the docs/THANKS file.
<p>  curl is developed by a community, with Daniel at the wheel.
<a name="What_do_you_get_for_making_curl"></a><h3>1.6 What do you get for making curl?</h3>
<p>  Project cURL is entirely free and open. No person gets paid for developing
   curl on full time. We do this voluntarily, mostly on spare time.
    Occasionally companies pay individual developers to work on curl, but that's
    up to each company and developer. It is not controlled by nor supervised in
    any way by the project.
 <p>  We still get help from companies. Haxx provides web site, bandwidth, mailing
   lists etc, sourceforge.net hosts project services we take advantage from,
    like the bug tracker and github hosts the primary git repository. Also
    again, some companies have sponsored certain parts of the development in the
    past and I hope some will continue to do so in the future.
 <p>  If you want to support our project, consider a donation or a banner-program
   or even better: by helping us coding, documenting, testing etc.
 <a name="What_about_CURL_from_curl_com"></a><h3>1.7 What about CURL from curl.com?</h3>
<p>  During the summer 2001, curl.com was busy advertising their client-side
   programming language for the web, named CURL.
 <p>  We are in no way associated with curl.com or their CURL programming
   language.
 <p>  Our project name curl has been in effective use since 1998. We were not the
   first computer related project to use the name "curl" and do not claim any
    rights to the name.
 <p>  We recognize that we will be living in parallel with curl.com and wish them
   every success.
 <a name="I_have_a_problem_who_do_I_mail"></a><h3>1.8 I have a problem who do I mail?</h3>
<p>  Please do not mail any single individual unless you really need to. Keep
   curl-related questions on a suitable mailing list. All available mailing
    lists are listed in the MANUAL document and online at
    <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/">http://curl.haxx.se/mail/</a>
 <p>  Keeping curl-related questions and discussions on mailing lists allows
   others to join in and help, to share their ideas, contribute their
    suggestions and spread their wisdom. Keeping discussions on public mailing
    lists also allows for others to learn from this (both current and future
    users thanks to the web based archives of the mailing lists), thus saving us
    from having to repeat ourselves even more. Thanks for respecting this.
 <p>  If you have found or simply suspect a security problem in curl or libcurl,
   mail curl-security at haxx.se (closed list of receivers, mails are not
    disclosed) and tell. Then we can produce a fix in a timely manner before the
    flaw is announced to the world, thus lessen the impact the problem will have
    on existing users.
 <a name="Where_do_I_buy_commercial_suppor"></a><h3>1.9 Where do I buy commercial support for curl?</h3>
<p>  curl is fully open source. It means you can hire any skilled engineer to fix
   your curl-related problems.
 <p>  We list available alternatives on the curl web site:
   <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/support.html">http://curl.haxx.se/support.html</a>
 <a name="How_many_are_using_curl"></a><h3>1.10 How many are using curl?</h3>
<p>  It is impossible to tell.
<p>  We don't know how many users that knowingly have installed and use curl.
<p>  We don't know how many users that use curl without knowing that they are in
   fact using it.
 <p>  We don't know how many users that downloaded or installed curl and then
   never use it.
 <p>  In May 2012 Daniel did a counting game and came up with a number that may
   be completely wrong or somewhat accurate. Over 500 million!
 <p>  See <a href="http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/05/16/300m-users/">http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/05/16/300m-users/</a>
<a name="Why_don_t_you_update_ca_bundle_c"></a><h3>1.11 Why don't you update ca-bundle.crt</h3>
<p>  The ca cert bundle that used to shipped with curl was very outdated and must
   be replaced with an up-to-date version by anyone who wants to verify
    peers. It is no longer provided by curl. The last curl release ever that
    shipped a ca cert bundle was curl 7.18.0.
 <p>  In the cURL project we've decided not to attempt to keep this file updated
   (or even present anymore) since deciding what to add to a ca cert bundle is
    an undertaking we've not been ready to accept, and the one we can get from
    Mozilla is perfectly fine so there's no need to duplicate that work.
 <p>  Today, with many services performed over HTTPS, every operating system
   should come with a default ca cert bundle that can be deemed somewhat
    trustworthy and that collection (if reasonably updated) should be deemed to
    be a lot better than a private curl version.
 <p>  If you want the most recent collection of ca certs that Mozilla Firefox
   uses, we recommend that you extract the collection yourself from Mozilla
    Firefox (by running 'make ca-bundle), or by using our online service setup
    for this purpose: <a href="caextract.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html</a>
 <a name="I_have_a_problem_who_can_I_chat"></a><h3>1.12 I have a problem who can I chat with?</h3>
<p>  There's a bunch of friendly people hanging out in the #curl channel on the
   IRC network irc.freenode.net. If you're polite and nice, chances are big

 <a name="curl_s_ECCN_number"></a><h3>1.13 curl's ECCN number?</h3>
<p>  The US government restricts exports of software that contains or uses
   cryptography. When doing so, the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)
    is used to identify the level of export control etc.
 <p>  Apache Software Foundation gives a good explanation of ECCNs at
   <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html">https://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html</a>
 <p>  We believe curl's number might be ECCN 5D002, another possibility is
   5D992. It seems necessary to write them (the authority that administers ECCN
    numbers), asking to confirm.
 <p>  Comprehensible explanations of the meaning of such numbers and how to obtain
   them (resp.) are here

 <a name="How_do_I_submit_my_patch"></a><h3>1.14 How do I submit my patch?</h3>
<p>  When you have made a patch or a change of whatever sort, and want to submit
   that to the project, there are a few different ways we prefer:
 <p>  o send a patch to the curl-library mailing list. We're many subscribers
<p>    there and there are lots of people who can review patches, comment on them
     and "receive" them properly.
 <p>  o if your patch changes or fixes a bug, you can also opt to submit a bug
<p>    report in the bug tracker and attach your patch there. There are less
     people involved there.
 <p>  Lots of more details are found in the CONTRIBUTE and INTERNALS docs.
<a name="How_do_I_port_libcurl_to_my_OS"></a><h3>1.15 How do I port libcurl to my OS?</h3>
<p>  Here's a rough step-by-step:
<p>  1. copy a suitable lib/config-*.h file as a start to lib/config-[youros].h
<p>  2. edit lib/config-[youros].h to match your OS and setup
<p>  3. edit lib/curl_setup.h to include config-[youros].h when your OS is
<pre>
 detected by the preprocessor, in the style others already exist
</pre>
<p>  4. compile lib/*.c and make them into a library
<h2>2. Install Related Problems</h2><a name="configure_doesn_t_find_OpenSSL_e"></a><h3>2.1 configure doesn't find OpenSSL even when it is installed</h3>
<p>  This may be because of several reasons.
<a name="native_linker_doesn_t_find_OpenS"></a><h3>2.1.1 native linker doesn't find openssl</h3>
<p>    Affected platforms:
<pre>
 Solaris (native cc compiler)
 HPUX (native cc compiler)
 SGI IRIX (native cc compiler)
 SCO UNIX (native cc compiler)
</pre>
<p>    When configuring curl, I specify --with-ssl. OpenSSL is installed in
     /usr/local/ssl Configure reports SSL in /usr/local/ssl, but fails to find
      CRYPTO_lock in -lcrypto
 <p>    Cause: The cc for this test places the -L/usr/local/ssl/lib AFTER
     -lcrypto, so ld can't find the library. This is due to a bug in the GNU
      autoconf tool.
 <p>    Workaround: Specifying "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/ssl/lib" in front of
     ./configure places the -L/usr/local/ssl/lib early enough in the command
      line to make things work
 <a name="only_the_libssl_lib_is_missing"></a><h3>2.1.2 only the libssl lib is missing</h3>
<p>    If all include files and the libcrypto lib is present, with only the
     libssl being missing according to configure, this is mostly likely because
      a few functions are left out from the libssl.
 <p>    If the function names missing include RSA or RSAREF you can be certain
     that this is because libssl requires the RSA and RSAREF libs to build.
 <p>    See the INSTALL file section that explains how to add those libs to
     configure. Make sure that you remove the config.cache file before you
      rerun configure with the new flags.
 <a name="Does_curl_work_build_with_other"></a><h3>2.2 Does curl work/build with other SSL libraries?</h3>
<p>  Curl has been written to use a generic SSL function layer internally, and
   that SSL functionality can then be provided by one out of many different SSL
    backends.
 <p>  curl can be built to use one of the following SSL alternatives: OpenSSL,
   GnuTLS, yassl, NSS, PolarSSL, axTLS, Secure Transport (native iOS/OS X),
    WinSSL (native Windows) or GSKit (native IBM i). They all have their pros
    and cons, and we try to maintain a comparison of them here:
    <a href="ssl-compared.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-compared.html</a>
 <a name="Where_can_I_find_a_copy_of_LIBEA"></a><h3>2.3 Where can I find a copy of LIBEAY32.DLL?</h3>
<p>  That is an OpenSSL binary built for Windows.
<p>  Curl can be built with OpenSSL to do the SSL stuff. The LIBEAY32.DLL is then
   what curl needs on a windows machine to do https:// etc. Check out the curl
    web site to find accurate and up-to-date pointers to recent OpenSSL DLLs and
    other binary packages.
 <a name="Does_curl_support_SOCKS_RFC_192"></a><h3>2.4 Does curl support SOCKS (RFC 1928) ?</h3>
<p>  Yes, SOCKS 4 and 5 are supported.
<h2>3. Usage problems</h2><a name="curl_1_SSL_is_disabled_https"></a><h3>3.1 curl: (1) SSL is disabled, https: not supported</h3>
<p>  If you get this output when trying to get anything from a https:// server,
   it means that the instance of curl/libcurl that you're using was built
    without support for this protocol.
 <p>  This could've happened if the configure script that was run at build time
   couldn't find all libs and include files curl requires for SSL to work. If
    the configure script fails to find them, curl is simply built without SSL
    support.
 <p>  To get the https:// support into a curl that was previously built but that
   reports that https:// is not supported, you should dig through the document
    and logs and check out why the configure script doesn't find the SSL libs
    and/or include files.
 <p>  Also, check out the other paragraph in this FAQ labelled "configure doesn't
   find OpenSSL even when it is installed".
 <a name="How_do_I_tell_curl_to_resume_a_t"></a><h3>3.2 How do I tell curl to resume a transfer?</h3>
<p>  Curl supports resumed transfers both ways on both FTP and HTTP.
   Try the -C option.
 <a name="Why_doesn_t_my_posting_using_F"></a><h3>3.3 Why doesn't my posting using -F work?</h3>
<p>  You can't simply use -F or -d at your choice. The web server that will
   receive your post expects one of the formats. If the form you're trying to
    submit uses the type 'multipart/form-data', then and only then you must use
    the -F type. In all the most common cases, you should use -d which then
    causes a posting with the type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
 <p>  This is described in some detail in the MANUAL and TheArtOfHttpScripting
   documents, and if you don't understand it the first time, read it again
    before you post questions about this to the mailing list. Also, try reading
    through the mailing list archives for old postings and questions regarding
    this.
 <a name="How_do_I_tell_curl_to_run_custom"></a><h3>3.4 How do I tell curl to run custom FTP commands?</h3>
<p>  You can tell curl to perform optional commands both before and/or after a
   file transfer. Study the -Q/--quote option.
 <p>  Since curl is used for file transfers, you don't normally use curl to
   perform FTP commands without transferring anything. Therefore you must
    always specify a URL to transfer to/from even when doing custom FTP
    commands, or use -I which implies the "no body" option sent to libcurl.
 <a name="How_can_I_disable_the_Accept"></a><h3>3.5 How can I disable the Accept: */ * header?</h3>
<p>  You can change all internally generated headers by adding a replacement with
   the -H/--header option. By adding a header with empty contents you safely
    disable that one. Use -H "Accept:" to disable that specific header.
 <a name="Does_curl_support_ASP_XML_XHTM"></a><h3>3.6 Does curl support ASP, XML, XHTML or HTML version Y?</h3>
<p>  To curl, all contents are alike. It doesn't matter how the page was
   generated. It may be ASP, PHP, Perl, shell-script, SSI or plain HTML
    files. There's no difference to curl and it doesn't even know what kind of
    language that generated the page.
 <p>  See also item 3.14 regarding javascript.
<a name="Can_I_use_curl_to_delete_rename"></a><h3>3.7 Can I use curl to delete/rename a file through FTP?</h3>
<p>  Yes. You specify custom FTP commands with -Q/--quote.
<p>  One example would be to delete a file after you have downloaded it:
<pre>
 curl -O <a href="ftp://download.com/coolfile">ftp://download.com/coolfile</a> -Q '-DELE coolfile'
</pre>
<p>  or rename a file after upload:
<pre>
 curl -T infile <a href="ftp://upload.com/dir/">ftp://upload.com/dir/</a> -Q "-RNFR infile" -Q "-RNTO newname"
</pre>
<a name="How_do_I_tell_curl_to_follow_HTT"></a><h3>3.8 How do I tell curl to follow HTTP redirects?</h3>
<p>  Curl does not follow so-called redirects by default. The Location: header
   that informs the client about this is only interpreted if you're using the
    -L/--location option. As in:
 <pre>
 curl -L <a href="http://redirector.com">http://redirector.com</a>
</pre>
<p>  Not all redirects are HTTP ones, see 4.14
<a name="How_do_I_use_curl_in_my_favorite"></a><h3>3.9 How do I use curl in my favorite programming language?</h3>
<p>  There exist many language interfaces/bindings for curl that integrates it
   better with various languages. If you are fluid in a script language, you
    may very well opt to use such an interface instead of using the command line
    tool.
 <p>  Find out more about which languages that support curl directly, and how to
   install and use them, in the libcurl section of the curl web site:
    <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/</a>
 <p>  All the various bindings to libcurl are made by other projects and people,
   outside of the cURL project. The cURL project itself only produces libcurl
    with its plain C API. If you don't find anywhere else to ask you can ask
    about bindings on the curl-library list too, but be prepared that people on
    that list may not know anything about bindings.
 <p>  In October 2009, there were interfaces available for the following
   languages: Ada95, Basic, C, C++, Ch, Cocoa, D, Dylan, Eiffel, Euphoria,
    Ferite, Gambas, glib/GTK+, Haskell, ILE/RPG, Java, Lisp, Lua, Mono, .NET,
    Object-Pascal, O'Caml, Pascal, Perl, PHP, PostgreSQL, Python, R, Rexx, Ruby,
    Scheme, S-Lang, Smalltalk, SP-Forth, SPL, Tcl, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro,
    Q, wxwidgets and XBLite. By the time you read this, additional ones may have
    appeared!
 <a name="What_about_SOAP_WebDAV_XML_RPC"></a><h3>3.10 What about SOAP, WebDAV, XML-RPC or similar protocols over HTTP?</h3>
<p>  Curl adheres to the HTTP spec, which basically means you can play with *any*
   protocol that is built on top of HTTP. Protocols such as SOAP, WEBDAV and
    XML-RPC are all such ones. You can use -X to set custom requests and -H to
    set custom headers (or replace internally generated ones).
 <p>  Using libcurl is of course just as fine and you'd just use the proper
   library options to do the same.
 <a name="How_do_I_POST_with_a_different_C"></a><h3>3.11 How do I POST with a different Content-Type?</h3>
<p>  You can always replace the internally generated headers with -H/--header.
   To make a simple HTTP POST with text/xml as content-type, do something like:
 <pre>
 curl -d "datatopost" -H "Content-Type: text/xml" [URL]
</pre>
<a name="Why_do_FTP_specific_features_ove"></a><h3>3.12 Why do FTP specific features over HTTP proxy fail?</h3>
<p>  Because when you use a HTTP proxy, the protocol spoken on the network will
   be HTTP, even if you specify a FTP URL. This effectively means that you
    normally can't use FTP specific features such as FTP upload and FTP quote
    etc.
 <p>  There is one exception to this rule, and that is if you can "tunnel through"
   the given HTTP proxy. Proxy tunneling is enabled with a special option (-p)
    and is generally not available as proxy admins usually disable tunneling to
    other ports than 443 (which is used for HTTPS access through proxies).
 <a name="Why_does_my_single_double_quotes"></a><h3>3.13 Why does my single/double quotes fail?</h3>
<p>  To specify a command line option that includes spaces, you might need to
   put the entire option within quotes. Like in:
 <p>   curl -d " with spaces " url.com
<p>  or perhaps
<p>   curl -d ' with spaces ' url.com
<p>  Exactly what kind of quotes and how to do this is entirely up to the shell
   or command line interpreter that you are using. For most unix shells, you
    can more or less pick either single (') or double (") quotes. For
    Windows/DOS prompts I believe you're forced to use double (") quotes.
 <p>  Please study the documentation for your particular environment. Examples in
   the curl docs will use a mix of both these ones as shown above. You must
    adjust them to work in your environment.
 <p>  Remember that curl works and runs on more operating systems than most single
   individuals have ever tried.
 <a name="Does_curl_support_Javascript_or"></a><h3>3.14 Does curl support Javascript or PAC (automated proxy config)?</h3>
<p>  Many web pages do magic stuff using embedded Javascript. Curl and libcurl
   have no built-in support for that, so it will be treated just like any other
    contents.
 <p>  .pac files are a netscape invention and are sometimes used by organizations
   to allow them to differentiate which proxies to use. The .pac contents is
    just a Javascript program that gets invoked by the browser and that returns
    the name of the proxy to connect to. Since curl doesn't support Javascript,
    it can't support .pac proxy configuration either.
 <p>  Some workarounds usually suggested to overcome this Javascript dependency:
<p>  Depending on the Javascript complexity, write up a script that translates it
   to another language and execute that.
 <p>  Read the Javascript code and rewrite the same logic in another language.
<p>  Implement a Javascript interpreter, people have successfully used the
   Mozilla Javascript engine in the past.
 <p>  Ask your admins to stop this, for a static proxy setup or similar.
<a name="Can_I_do_recursive_fetches_with"></a><h3>3.15 Can I do recursive fetches with curl?</h3>
<p>  No. curl itself has no code that performs recursive operations, such as
   those performed by wget and similar tools.
 <p>  There exist wrapper scripts with that functionality (for example the
   curlmirror perl script), and you can write programs based on libcurl to do
    it, but the command line tool curl itself cannot.
 <a name="What_certificates_do_I_need_when"></a><h3>3.16 What certificates do I need when I use SSL?</h3>
<p>  There are three different kinds of "certificates" to keep track of when we
   talk about using SSL-based protocols (HTTPS or FTPS) using curl or libcurl.
 <p>  CLIENT CERTIFICATE
<p>  The server you communicate may require that you can provide this in order to
   prove that you actually are who you claim to be.  If the server doesn't
    require this, you don't need a client certificate.
 <p>  A client certificate is always used together with a private key, and the
   private key has a pass phrase that protects it.
 <p>  SERVER CERTIFICATE
<p>  The server you communicate with has a server certificate. You can and should
   verify this certificate to make sure that you are truly talking to the real
    server and not a server impersonating it.
 <p>  CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY CERTIFICATE ("CA cert")
<p>  You often have several CA certs in a CA cert bundle that can be used to
   verify a server certificate that was signed by one of the authorities in the
    bundle. curl does not come with a CA cert bundle but most curl installs
    provide one. You can also override the default.
 <p>  The server certificate verification process is made by using a Certificate
   Authority certificate ("CA cert") that was used to sign the server
    certificate. Server certificate verification is enabled by default in curl
    and libcurl and is often the reason for problems as explained in FAQ entry
    4.12 and the SSLCERTS document
    (<a href="sslcerts.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</a>). Server certificates that are
    "self-signed" or otherwise signed by a CA that you do not have a CA cert
    for, cannot be verified. If the verification during a connect fails, you are
    refused access. You then need to explicitly disable the verification to
    connect to the server.
 <a name="How_do_I_list_the_root_dir_of_an"></a><h3>3.17 How do I list the root dir of an FTP server?</h3>
<p>  There are two ways. The way defined in the RFC is to use an encoded slash
   in the first path part. List the "/tmp" dir like this:
 <pre>
 curl <a href="ftp://ftp.sunet.se/%2ftmp/">ftp://ftp.sunet.se/%2ftmp/</a>
</pre>
<p>  or the not-quite-kosher-but-more-readable way, by simply starting the path
   section of the URL with a slash:
 <pre>
 curl <a href="ftp://ftp.sunet.se//tmp/">ftp://ftp.sunet.se//tmp/</a>
</pre>
<a name="Can_I_use_curl_to_send_a_POST_PU"></a><h3>3.18 Can I use curl to send a POST/PUT and not wait for a response?</h3>
<p>  No.
<p>  But you could easily write your own program using libcurl to do such stunts.
<a name="How_do_I_get_HTTP_from_a_host_us"></a><h3>3.19 How do I get HTTP from a host using a specific IP address?</h3>
<p>  For example, you may be trying out a web site installation that isn't yet in
   the DNS. Or you have a site using multiple IP addresses for a given host
    name and you want to address a specific one out of the set.
 <p>  Set a custom Host: header that identifies the server name you want to reach
   but use the target IP address in the URL:
 <p>    curl --header "Host: www.example.com" <a href="http://127.0.0.1/">http://127.0.0.1/</a>
<p>  You can also opt to add faked host name entries to curl with the --resolve
   option. That has the added benefit that things like redirects will also work
    properly. The above operation would instead be done as:
 <p>    curl --resolve www.example.com:80:127.0.0.1 <a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>
<a name="How_to_SFTP_from_my_user_s_home"></a><h3>3.20 How to SFTP from my user's home directory?</h3>
<p>  Contrary to how FTP works, SFTP and SCP URLs specify the exact directory to
   work with. It means that if you don't specify that you want the user's home
    directory, you get the actual root directory.
 <p>  To specify a file in your user's home directory, you need to use the correct
   URL syntax which for sftp might look similar to:
 <p>    curl -O -u user:password s<a href="ftp://example.com/">ftp://example.com/</a>~/file.txt
<p>  and for SCP it is just a different protocol prefix:
<p>    curl -O -u user:password scp://example.com/~/file.txt
<a name="Protocol_xxx_not_supported_or_di"></a><h3>3.21 Protocol xxx not supported or disabled in libcurl</h3>
<p>  When passing on a URL to curl to use, it may respond that the particular
   protocol is not supported or disabled. The particular way this error message
    is phrased is because curl doesn't make a distinction internally of whether
    a particular protocol is not supported (i.e. never got any code added that
    knows how to speak that protocol) or if it was explicitly disabled. curl can
    be built to only support a given set of protocols, and the rest would then
    be disabled or not supported.
 <p>  Note that this error will also occur if you pass a wrongly spelled protocol
   part as in "htpt://example.com" or as in the less evident case if you prefix
    the protocol part with a space as in " <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>".
 <a name="curl_X_gives_me_HTTP_problems"></a><h3>3.22 curl -X gives me HTTP problems</h3>
<p>  In normal circumstances, -X should hardly ever be used.
<p>  By default you use curl without explicitly saying which request method to
   use when the URL identifies a HTTP transfer. If you just pass in a URL like
    "curl <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>" it will use GET. If you use -d or -F curl will use
    POST, -I will cause a HEAD and -T will make it a PUT.
 <p>  If for whatever reason you're not happy with these default choices that curl
   does for you, you can override those request methods by specifying -X
    [WHATEVER]. This way you can for example send a DELETE by doing "curl -X
    DELETE [URL]".
 <p>  It is thus pointless to do "curl -XGET [URL]" as GET would be used
   anyway. In the same vein it is pointless to do "curl -X POST -d data
    [URL]"... But you can make a fun and somewhat rare request that sends a
    request-body in a GET request with something like "curl -X GET -d data
    [URL]"
 <p>  Note that -X doesn't actually change curl's behavior as it only modifies the
   actual string sent in the request, but that may of course trigger a
    different set of events.
 <p>  Accordingly, by using -XPOST on a command line that for example would follow
   a 303 redirect, you will effectively prevent curl from behaving
    correctly. Be aware.
 <h2>4. Running Problems</h2><a name="Problems_connecting_to_SSL_serve"></a><h3>4.1 Problems connecting to SSL servers.</h3>
<p>  It took a very long time before we could sort out why curl had problems to
   connect to certain SSL servers when using SSLeay or OpenSSL v0.9+.  The
    error sometimes showed up similar to:
 <p>  16570:error:1407D071:SSL routines:SSL2_READ:bad mac decode:s2_pkt.c:233:
<p>  It turned out to be because many older SSL servers don't deal with SSLv3
   requests properly. To correct this problem, tell curl to select SSLv2 from
    the command line (-2/--sslv2).
 <p>  There have also been examples where the remote server didn't like the SSLv2
   request and instead you had to force curl to use SSLv3 with -3/--sslv3.
 <a name="Why_do_I_get_problems_when_I_use"></a><h3>4.2 Why do I get problems when I use &amp; or % in the URL?</h3>
<p>  In general unix shells, the &amp; symbol is treated specially and when used, it
   runs the specified command in the background. To safely send the &amp; as a part
    of a URL, you should quote the entire URL by using single (') or double (")
    quotes around it. Similar problems can also occur on some shells with other
    characters, including ?*!$~(){}&lt;&gt;\|;`.  When in doubt, quote the URL.
 <p>  An example that would invoke a remote CGI that uses &amp;-symbols could be:
<pre>
 curl '<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?text=yes&amp;q=curl">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?text=yes&amp;q=curl</a>'
</pre>
<p>  In Windows, the standard DOS shell treats the percent sign specially and you
   need to use TWO percent signs for each single one you want to use in the
    URL.
 <p>  If you want a literal percent sign to be part of the data you pass in a POST
   using -d/--data you must encode it as '%25' (which then also needs the
    percent sign doubled on Windows machines).
 <a name="How_can_I_use_or_to_sp"></a><h3>4.3 How can I use {, }, [ or ] to specify multiple URLs?</h3>
<p>  Because those letters have a special meaning to the shell, and to be used in
   a URL specified to curl you must quote them.
 <p>  An example that downloads two URLs (sequentially) would do:
<p>    curl '{curl,www}.haxx.se'
<p>  To be able to use those letters as actual parts of the URL (without using
   them for the curl URL "globbing" system), use the -g/--globoff option:
 <p>    curl -g 'www.site.com/weirdname[].html'
<a name="Why_do_I_get_downloaded_data_eve"></a><h3>4.4 Why do I get downloaded data even though the web page doesn't exist?</h3>
<p>  Curl asks remote servers for the page you specify. If the page doesn't exist
   at the server, the HTTP protocol defines how the server should respond and
    that means that headers and a "page" will be returned. That's simply how
    HTTP works.
 <p>  By using the --fail option you can tell curl explicitly to not get any data
   if the HTTP return code doesn't say success.
 <a name="Why_do_I_get_return_code_XXX_fro"></a><h3>4.5 Why do I get return code XXX from a HTTP server?</h3>
<p>  RFC2616 clearly explains the return codes. This is a short transcript. Go
   read the RFC for exact details:
 <a name="400_Bad_Request"></a><h3>4.5.1 "400 Bad Request"</h3>
<p>    The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed
     syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
 <a name="401_Unauthorized"></a><h3>4.5.2 "401 Unauthorized"</h3>
<p>    The request requires user authentication.
<a name="403_Forbidden"></a><h3>4.5.3 "403 Forbidden"</h3>
<p>    The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfil it.
     Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
 <a name="404_Not_Found"></a><h3>4.5.4 "404 Not Found"</h3>
<p>    The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication
     is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.
 <a name="405_Method_Not_Allowed"></a><h3>4.5.5 "405 Method Not Allowed"</h3>
<p>    The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the resource
     identified by the Request-URI. The response MUST include an Allow header
      containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource.
 <a name="301_Moved_Permanently"></a><h3>4.5.6 "301 Moved Permanently"</h3>
<p>    If you get this return code and an HTML output similar to this:
<pre>
 &lt;H1&gt;Moved Permanently&lt;/H1&gt; The document has moved &lt;A
 HREF="<a href="http://same_url_now_with_a_trailing_slash/">http://same_url_now_with_a_trailing_slash/</a>"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.
</pre>
<p>    it might be because you request a directory URL but without the trailing
     slash. Try the same operation again <em>with</em> the trailing URL, or use the
      -L/--location option to follow the redirection.
 <a name="Can_you_tell_me_what_error_code"></a><h3>4.6 Can you tell me what error code 142 means?</h3>
<p>  All curl error codes are described at the end of the man page, in the
   section called "EXIT CODES".
 <p>  Error codes that are larger than the highest documented error code means
   that curl has exited due to a crash. This is a serious error, and we
    appreciate a detailed bug report from you that describes how we could go
    ahead and repeat this!
 <a name="How_do_I_keep_user_names_and_pas"></a><h3>4.7 How do I keep user names and passwords secret in Curl command lines?</h3>
<p>  This problem has two sides:
<p>  The first part is to avoid having clear-text passwords in the command line
   so that they don't appear in 'ps' outputs and similar. That is easily
    avoided by using the "-K" option to tell curl to read parameters from a file
    or stdin to which you can pass the secret info. curl itself will also
    attempt to "hide" the given password by blanking out the option - this
    doesn't work on all platforms.
 <p>  To keep the passwords in your account secret from the rest of the world is
   not a task that curl addresses. You could of course encrypt them somehow to
    at least hide them from being read by human eyes, but that is not what
    anyone would call security.
 <p>  Also note that regular HTTP (using Basic authentication) and FTP passwords
   are sent in clear across the network. All it takes for anyone to fetch them
    is to listen on the network.  Eavesdropping is very easy. Use more secure
    authentication methods (like Digest, Negotiate or even NTLM) or consider the
    SSL-based alternatives HTTPS and FTPS.
 <a name="I_found_a_bug"></a><h3>4.8 I found a bug!</h3>
<p>  It is not a bug if the behavior is documented. Read the docs first.
   Especially check out the KNOWN_BUGS file, it may be a documented bug!
 <p>  If it is a problem with a binary you've downloaded or a package for your
   particular platform, try contacting the person who built the package/archive
    you have.
 <p>  If there is a bug, read the BUGS document first. Then report it as described
   in there.
 <a name="Curl_can_t_authenticate_to_the_s"></a><h3>4.9 Curl can't authenticate to the server that requires NTLM?</h3>
<p>  NTLM support requires OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS, Secure Transport, or Microsoft
   Windows libraries at build-time to provide this functionality.
 <p>  NTLM is a Microsoft proprietary protocol. Proprietary formats are evil. You
   should not use such ones.
 <a name="My_HTTP_request_using_HEAD_PUT"></a><h3>4.10 My HTTP request using HEAD, PUT or DELETE doesn't work!</h3>
<p>  Many web servers allow or demand that the administrator configures the
   server properly for these requests to work on the web server.
 <p>  Some servers seem to support HEAD only on certain kinds of URLs.
<p>  To fully grasp this, try the documentation for the particular server
   software you're trying to interact with. This is not anything curl can do
    anything about.
 <a name="Why_does_my_HTTP_range_requests"></a><h3>4.11 Why does my HTTP range requests return the full document?</h3>
<p>  Because the range may not be supported by the server, or the server may
   choose to ignore it and return the full document anyway.
 <a name="Why_do_I_get_certificate_verify"></a><h3>4.12 Why do I get "certificate verify failed" ?</h3>
<p>  You invoke curl 7.10 or later to communicate on a https:// URL and get an
   error back looking something similar to this:
 <pre>
 curl: (35) SSL: error:14090086:SSL routines:
 SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
</pre>
<p>  Then it means that curl couldn't verify that the server's certificate was
   good. Curl verifies the certificate using the CA cert bundle that comes with
    the curl installation.
 <p>  To disable the verification (which makes it act like curl did before 7.10),
   use -k. This does however enable man-in-the-middle attacks.
 <p>  If you get this failure but are having a CA cert bundle installed and used,
   the server's certificate is not signed by one of the CA's in the bundle. It
    might for example be self-signed. You then correct this problem by obtaining
    a valid CA cert for the server. Or again, decrease the security by disabling
    this check.
 <p>  Details are also in the SSLCERTS file in the release archives, found online
   here: <a href="sslcerts.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html</a>
 <a name="Why_is_curl_R_on_Windows_one_ho"></a><h3>4.13 Why is curl -R on Windows one hour off?</h3>
<p>  During daylight savings time, when -R is used, curl will set a time that
   appears one hour off. This happens due to a flaw in how Windows stores and
    uses file modification times and it is not easily worked around. For details
    on this problem, read this: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/datetime/dstbugs.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/datetime/dstbugs.asp</a>
 <a name="Redirects_work_in_browser_but_no"></a><h3>4.14 Redirects work in browser but not with curl!</h3>
<p>  curl supports HTTP redirects fine (see item 3.8). Browsers generally support
   at least two other ways to perform redirects that curl does not:
 <p>  Meta tags. You can write a HTML tag that will cause the browser to redirect
   to another given URL after a certain time.
 <p>  Javascript. You can write a Javascript program embedded in a HTML page that
   redirects the browser to another given URL.
 <p>  There is no way to make curl follow these redirects. You must either
   manually figure out what the page is set to do, or you write a script that
    parses the results and fetches the new URL.
 <a name="FTPS_doesn_t_work"></a><h3>4.15 FTPS doesn't work</h3>
<p>  curl supports FTPS (sometimes known as FTP-SSL) both implicit and explicit
   mode.
 <p>  When a URL is used that starts with FTPS://, curl assumes implicit SSL on
   the control connection and will therefore immediately connect and try to
    speak SSL. FTPS:// connections default to port 990.
 <p>  To use explicit FTPS, you use a FTP:// URL and the --ftp-ssl option (or one
   of its related flavours). This is the most common method, and the one
    mandated by RFC4217. This kind of connection then of course uses the
    standard FTP port 21 by default.
 <a name="My_HTTP_POST_or_PUT_requests_are"></a><h3>4.16 My HTTP POST or PUT requests are slow!</h3>
<p>  libcurl makes all POST and PUT requests (except for POST requests with a
   very tiny request body) use the "Expect: 100-continue" header. This header
    allows the server to deny the operation early so that libcurl can bail out
    already before having to send any data. This is useful in authentication
    cases and others.
 <p>  However, many servers don't implement the Expect: stuff properly and if the
   server doesn't respond (positively) within 1 second libcurl will continue
    and send off the data anyway.
 <p>  You can disable libcurl's use of the Expect: header the same way you disable
   any header, using -H / CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, or by forcing it to use HTTP 1.0.
 <a name="Non_functional_connect_timeouts"></a><h3>4.17 Non-functional connect timeouts</h3>
<p>  In most Windows setups having a timeout longer than 21 seconds make no
   difference, as it will only send 3 TCP SYN packets and no more. The second
    packet sent three seconds after the first and the third six seconds after
    the second.  No more than three packets are sent, no matter how long the
    timeout is set.
 <p>  See option TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions on this page:
   <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/175523/en-us">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/175523/en-us</a>
 <p>  Also, even on non-Windows systems there may run a firewall or anti-virus
   software or similar that accepts the connection but does not actually do
    anything else. This will make (lib)curl to consider the connection connected
    and thus the connect timeout won't trigger.
 <a name="file_URLs_containing_drive_le"></a><h3>4.18 file:// URLs containing drive letters (Windows, NetWare)</h3>
<p>  When using cURL to try to download a local file, one might use a URL
   in this format:
 <p>  file://D:/blah.txt
<p>  You'll find that even if D:\blah.txt does exist, cURL returns a 'file
   not found' error.
 <p>  According to RFC 1738 (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt</a>),
   file:// URLs must contain a host component, but it is ignored by
    most implementations. In the above example, 'D:' is treated as the
    host component, and is taken away. Thus, cURL tries to open '/blah.txt'.
    If your system is installed to drive C:, that will resolve to 'C:\blah.txt',
    and if that doesn't exist you will get the not found error.
 <p>  To fix this problem, use file:// URLs with *three* leading slashes:
<p>  file:///D:/blah.txt
<p>  Alternatively, if it makes more sense, specify 'localhost' as the host
   component:
 <p>  file://localhost/D:/blah.txt
<p>  In either case, cURL should now be looking for the correct file.
<a name="Why_doesn_t_cURL_return_an_error"></a><h3>4.19 Why doesn't cURL return an error when the network cable is unplugged?</h3>
<p>  Unplugging a cable is not an error situation. The TCP/IP protocol stack
   was designed to be fault tolerant, so even though there may be a physical
    break somewhere the connection shouldn't be affected, just possibly
    delayed.  Eventually, the physical break will be fixed or the data will be
    re-routed around the physical problem through another path.
 <p>  In such cases, the TCP/IP stack is responsible for detecting when the
   network connection is irrevocably lost. Since with some protocols it is
    perfectly legal for the client wait indefinitely for data, the stack may
    never report a problem, and even when it does, it can take up to 20 minutes
    for it to detect an issue.  The curl option --keepalive-time enables
    keep-alive support in the TCP/IP stack which makes it periodically probe the
    connection to make sure it is still available to send data. That should
    reliably detect any TCP/IP network failure.
 <p>  But even that won't detect the network going down before the TCP/IP
   connection is established (e.g. during a DNS lookup) or using protocols that
    don't use TCP.  To handle those situations, curl offers a number of timeouts
    on its own. --speed-limit/--speed-time will abort if the data transfer rate
    falls too low, and --connect-timeout and --max-time can be used to put an
    overall timeout on the connection phase or the entire transfer.
 <p>  A libcurl-using application running in a known physical environment (e.g.
   an embedded device with only a single network connection) may want to act
    immediately if its lone network connection goes down.  That can be achieved
    by having the application monitor the network connection on its own using an
    OS-specific mechanism, then signalling libcurl to abort (see also item 5.13).
 <a name="curl_doesn_t_return_error_for_HT"></a><h3>4.20 curl doesn't return error for HTTP non-200 responses!</h3>
<p>  Correct. Unless you use -f (--fail).
<p>  When doing HTTP transfers, curl will perform exactly what you're asking it
   to do and if successful it will not return an error. You can use curl to
    test your web server's "file not found" page (that gets 404 back), you can
    use it to check your authentication protected web pages (that get a 401
    back) and so on.
 <p>  The specific HTTP response code does not constitute a problem or error for
   curl. It simply sends and delivers HTTP as you asked and if that worked,
    everything is fine and dandy. The response code is generally providing more
    higher level error information that curl doesn't care about. The error was
    not in the HTTP transfer.
 <p>  If you want your command line to treat error codes in the 400 and up range
   as errors and thus return a non-zero value and possibly show an error
    message, curl has a dedicated option for that: -f (CURLOPT_FAILONERROR in
    libcurl speak).
 <p>  You can also use the -w option and the variable %{response_code} to extract
   the exact response code that was return in the response.
 <a name="Why_is_there_a_HTTP_1_1_in_my_HT"></a><h3>4.21 Why is there a HTTP/1.1 in my HTTP/2 request?</h3>
<p>  If you use verbose to see the HTTP request when you send off a HTTP/2
   request, it will still say 1.1.
 <p>  The reason for this is that we first generate the request to send using the
   old 1.1 style and show that request in the verbose output, and then we
    convert it over to the binary header-compressed HTTP/2 style. The actual
    "1.1" part from that request is then not actually used in the transfer. The
    binary HTTP/2 headers are not human readable.
 <h2>5. libcurl Issues</h2><a name="Is_libcurl_thread_safe"></a><h3>5.1 Is libcurl thread-safe?</h3>
<p>  Yes.
<p>  We have written the libcurl code specifically adjusted for multi-threaded
   programs. libcurl will use thread-safe functions instead of non-safe ones if
    your system has such.  Note that you must never share the same handle in
    multiple threads.
 <p>  libcurl's implementation of timeouts might use signals (depending on what it
   was built to use for name resolving), and signal handling is generally not
    thread-safe.  Multi-threaded Applicationss that call libcurl from different
    threads (on different handles) might want to use CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL, e.g.:
 <p>    curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL, true);
<p>  If you use a OpenSSL-powered libcurl in a multi-threaded environment, you
   need to provide one or two locking functions:
 <p>    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html">https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html</a>
<p>  If you use a GnuTLS-powered libcurl in a multi-threaded environment, you
   need to provide locking function(s) for libgcrypt (which is used by GnuTLS
    for the crypto functions).
 <p>    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111103083330/http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Multi_002dthreaded-applications.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20111103083330/http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Multi_002dthreaded-applications.html</a>
<p>  No special locking is needed with a NSS-powered libcurl. NSS is thread-safe.
<a name="How_can_I_receive_all_data_into"></a><h3>5.2 How can I receive all data into a large memory chunk?</h3>
<p>  [ See also the examples/getinmemory.c source ]
<p>  You are in full control of the callback function that gets called every time
   there is data received from the remote server. You can make that callback do
    whatever you want. You do not have to write the received data to a file.
 <p>  One solution to this problem could be to have a pointer to a struct that you
   pass to the callback function. You set the pointer using the
    CURLOPT_WRITEDATA option. Then that pointer will be passed to the callback
    instead of a FILE * to a file:
 <pre>
 /* imaginary struct */
 struct MemoryStruct {
 char *memory;
 size_t size;
 };
</pre>
<pre>
 /* imaginary callback function */
 size_t
 WriteMemoryCallback(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *data)
 {
 size_t realsize = size * nmemb;
 struct MemoryStruct *mem = (struct MemoryStruct *)data;
</pre>
<pre>
 mem-&gt;memory = (char *)realloc(mem-&gt;memory, mem-&gt;size + realsize + 1);
 if (mem-&gt;memory) {
 memcpy(&amp;(mem-&gt;memory[mem-&gt;size]), ptr, realsize);
 mem-&gt;size += realsize;
 mem-&gt;memory[mem-&gt;size] = 0;
 }
 return realsize;
 }
</pre>
<a name="How_do_I_fetch_multiple_files_wi"></a><h3>5.3 How do I fetch multiple files with libcurl?</h3>
<p>  libcurl has excellent support for transferring multiple files. You should
   just repeatedly set new URLs with curl_easy_setopt() and then transfer it
    with curl_easy_perform(). The handle you get from curl_easy_init() is not
    only reusable, but you're even encouraged to reuse it if you can, as that
    will enable libcurl to use persistent connections.
 <a name="Does_libcurl_do_Winsock_initing"></a><h3>5.4 Does libcurl do Winsock initialization on win32 systems?</h3>
<p>  Yes, if told to in the curl_global_init() call.
<a name="Does_CURLOPT_WRITEDATA_and_CURLO"></a><h3>5.5 Does CURLOPT_WRITEDATA and CURLOPT_READDATA work on win32 ?</h3>
<p>  Yes, but you cannot open a FILE * and pass the pointer to a DLL and have
   that DLL use the FILE * (as the DLL and the client application cannot access
    each others' variable memory areas). If you set CURLOPT_WRITEDATA you must
    also use CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION as well to set a function that writes the
    file, even if that simply writes the data to the specified FILE *.
    Similarly, if you use CURLOPT_READDATA you must also specify
    CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.
 <a name="What_about_Keep_Alive_or_persist"></a><h3>5.6 What about Keep-Alive or persistent connections?</h3>
<p>  curl and libcurl have excellent support for persistent connections when
   transferring several files from the same server.  Curl will attempt to reuse
    connections for all URLs specified on the same command line/config file, and
    libcurl will reuse connections for all transfers that are made using the
    same libcurl handle.
 <p>  When you use the easy interface, the connection cache is kept within the
   easy handle. If you instead use the multi interface, the connection cache
    will be kept within the multi handle and will be shared among all the easy
    handles that are used within the same multi handle.
 <a name="Link_errors_when_building_libcur"></a><h3>5.7 Link errors when building libcurl on Windows!</h3>
<p>  You need to make sure that your project, and all the libraries (both static
   and dynamic) that it links against, are compiled/linked against the same run
    time library.
 <p>  This is determined by the /MD, /ML, /MT (and their corresponding /M?d)
   options to the command line compiler. /MD (linking against MSVCRT dll) seems
    to be the most commonly used option.
 <p>  When building an application that uses the static libcurl library, you must
   add -DCURL_STATICLIB to your CFLAGS. Otherwise the linker will look for
    dynamic import symbols. If you're using Visual Studio, you need to instead
    add CURL_STATICLIB in the "Preprocessor Definitions" section.
 <p>  If you get linker error like "unknown symbol __imp__curl_easy_init ..." you
   have linked against the wrong (static) library.  If you want to use the
    libcurl.dll and import lib, you don't need any extra CFLAGS, but use one of
    the import libraries below. These are the libraries produced by the various
    lib/Makefile.* files:
 <pre>
 Target: static lib. import lib for libcurl*.dll.
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 MingW: libcurl.a libcurldll.a
 MSVC (release): libcurl.lib libcurl_imp.lib
 MSVC (debug): libcurld.lib libcurld_imp.lib
 Borland: libcurl.lib libcurl_imp.lib
</pre>
<a name="libcurl_so_X_open_failed_No_su"></a><h3>5.8 libcurl.so.X: open failed: No such file or directory</h3>
<p>  This is an error message you might get when you try to run a program linked
   with a shared version of libcurl and your run-time linker (ld.so) couldn't
    find the shared library named libcurl.so.X. (Where X is the number of the
    current libcurl ABI, typically 3 or 4).
 <p>  You need to make sure that ld.so finds libcurl.so.X. You can do that
   multiple ways, and it differs somewhat between different operating systems,
    but they are usually:
 <p>  * Add an option to the linker command line that specify the hard-coded path
<p>    the run-time linker should check for the lib (usually -R)
<p>  * Set an environment variable (LD_LIBRARY_PATH for example) where ld.so
<p>    should check for libs
<p>  * Adjust the system's config to check for libs in the directory where you've
<p>    put the dir (like Linux's /etc/ld.so.conf)
<p>  'man ld.so' and 'man ld' will tell you more details
<a name="How_does_libcurl_resolve_host_na"></a><h3>5.9 How does libcurl resolve host names?</h3>
<p>  libcurl supports a large a number of different name resolve functions. One
   of them is picked at build-time and will be used unconditionally. Thus, if
    you want to change name resolver function you must rebuild libcurl and tell
    it to use a different function.
 <p>  - The non-IPv6 resolver that can use one out of four host name resolve calls
<p>    (depending on what your system supports):
<pre>
 A - gethostbyname()
 B - gethostbyname_r() with 3 arguments
 C - gethostbyname_r() with 5 arguments
 D - gethostbyname_r() with 6 arguments
</pre>
<p>  - The IPv6-resolver that uses getaddrinfo()
<p>  - The c-ares based name resolver that uses the c-ares library for resolves.
<p>    Using this offers asynchronous name resolves.
<p>  - The threaded resolver (default option on Windows). It uses:
<pre>
 A - gethostbyname() on plain IPv4 hosts
 B - getaddrinfo() on IPv6 enabled hosts
</pre>
<p>  Also note that libcurl never resolves or reverse-lookups addresses given as
   pure numbers, such as 127.0.0.1 or ::1.
 <a name="How_do_I_prevent_libcurl_from_wr"></a><h3>5.10 How do I prevent libcurl from writing the response to stdout?</h3>
<p>  libcurl provides a default built-in write function that writes received data
   to stdout. Set the CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION to receive the data, or possibly
    set CURLOPT_WRITEDATA to a different FILE * handle.
 <a name="How_do_I_make_libcurl_not_receiv"></a><h3>5.11 How do I make libcurl not receive the whole HTTP response?</h3>
<p>  You make the write callback (or progress callback) return an error and
   libcurl will then abort the transfer.
 <a name="Can_I_make_libcurl_fake_or_hide"></a><h3>5.12 Can I make libcurl fake or hide my real IP address?</h3>
<p>  No. libcurl operates on a higher level. Besides, faking IP address would
   imply sending IP packet with a made-up source address, and then you normally
    get a problem with receiving the packet sent back as they would then not be
    routed to you!
 <p>  If you use a proxy to access remote sites, the sites will not see your local
   IP address but instead the address of the proxy.
 <p>  Also note that on many networks NATs or other IP-munging techniques are used
   that makes you see and use a different IP address locally than what the
    remote server will see you coming from. You may also consider using
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a> .
 <a name="How_do_I_stop_an_ongoing_transfe"></a><h3>5.13 How do I stop an ongoing transfer?</h3>
<p>  With the easy interface you make sure to return the correct error code from
   one of the callbacks, but none of them are instant. There is no function you
    can call from another thread or similar that will stop it immediately.
    Instead, you need to make sure that one of the callbacks you use returns an
    appropriate value that will stop the transfer.  Suitable callbacks that you
    can do this with include the progress callback, the read callback and the
    write callback.
 <p>  If you're using the multi interface, you can also stop a transfer by
   removing the particular easy handle from the multi stack at any moment you
    think the transfer is done or when you wish to abort the transfer.
 <a name="Using_C_non_static_functions_f"></a><h3>5.14 Using C++ non-static functions for callbacks?</h3>
<p>  libcurl is a C library, it doesn't know anything about C++ member functions.
<p>  You can overcome this "limitation" with a relative ease using a static
   member function that is passed a pointer to the class:
 <pre>
 // f is the pointer to your object.
 static YourClass::func(void *buffer, size_t sz, size_t n, void *f)
 {
 // Call non-static member function.
 static_cast&lt;YourClass*&gt;(f)-&gt;nonStaticFunction();
 }
</pre>
<pre>
 // This is how you pass pointer to the static function:
 curl_easy_setopt(hcurl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, YourClass:func);
 curl_easy_setopt(hcurl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, this);
</pre>
<a name="How_do_I_get_an_FTP_directory_li"></a><h3>5.15 How do I get an FTP directory listing?</h3>
<p>  If you end the FTP URL you request with a slash, libcurl will provide you
   with a directory listing of that given directory. You can also set
    CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST to alter what exact listing command libcurl would use
    to list the files.
 <p>  The follow-up question that tend to follow the previous one, is how a
   program is supposed to parse the directory listing. How does it know what's
    a file and what's a dir and what's a symlink etc. The harsh reality is that
    FTP provides no such fine and easy-to-parse output. The output format FTP
    servers respond to LIST commands are entirely at the server's own liking and
    the NLST output doesn't reveal any types and in many cases don't even
    include all the directory entries. Also, both LIST and NLST tend to hide
    unix-style hidden files (those that start with a dot) by default so you need
    to do "LIST -a" or similar to see them.
 <p>  The application thus needs to parse the LIST output. One such existing
   list parser is available at <a href="http://cr.yp.to/ftpparse.html">http://cr.yp.to/ftpparse.html</a>  Versions of
    libcurl since 7.21.0 also provide the ability to specify a wildcard to
    download multiple files from one FTP directory.
 <a name="I_want_a_different_time_out"></a><h3>5.16 I want a different time-out!</h3>
<p>  Time and time again users realize that CURLOPT_TIMEOUT and
   CURLOPT_CONNECTIMEOUT are not sufficiently advanced or flexible to cover all
    the various use cases and scenarios applications end up with.
 <p>  libcurl offers many more ways to time-out operations. A common alternative
   is to use the CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT and CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME options to
    specify the lowest possible speed to accept before to consider the transfer
    timed out.
 <p>  The most flexible way is by writing your own time-out logic and using
   CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION (perhaps in combination with other callbacks) and
    use that to figure out exactly when the right condition is met when the
    transfer should get stopped.
 <a name="Can_I_write_a_server_with_libcur"></a><h3>5.17 Can I write a server with libcurl?</h3>
<p>  No. libcurl offers no functions or building blocks to build any kind of
   internet protocol server. libcurl is only a client-side library. For server
    libraries, you need to continue your search elsewhere but there exist many
    good open source ones out there for most protocols you could possibly want a
    server for. And there are really good stand-alone ones that have been tested
    and proven for many years. There's no need for you to reinvent them!
 <a name="Does_libcurl_use_threads"></a><h3>5.18 Does libcurl use threads?</h3>
<p>  Put simply: no, libcurl will execute in the same thread you call it in. All
   callbacks will be called in the same thread as the one you call libcurl in.
 <p>  If you want to avoid your thread to be blocked by the libcurl call, you make
   sure you use the non-blocking API which will do transfers asynchronously -
    but still in the same single thread.
 <p>  libcurl will potentially internally use threads for name resolving, if it
   was built to work like that, but in those cases it'll create the child
    threads by itself and they will only be used and then killed internally by
    libcurl and never exposed to the outside.
 <h2>6. License Issues</h2><p>  Curl and libcurl are released under a MIT/X derivate license. The license is
   very liberal and should not impose a problem for your project. This section
    is just a brief summary for the cases we get the most questions. (Parts of
    this section was much enhanced by Bjorn Reese.)
 <p>  We are not lawyers and this is not legal advice. You should probably consult
   one if you want true and accurate legal insights without our prejudice. Note
    especially that this section concerns the libcurl license only; compiling in
    features of libcurl that depend on other libraries (e.g. OpenSSL) may affect
    the licensing obligations of your application.
 <a name="I_have_a_GPL_program_can_I_use"></a><h3>6.1 I have a GPL program, can I use the libcurl library?</h3>
<p>  Yes!
<p>  Since libcurl may be distributed under the MIT/X derivate license, it can be
   used together with GPL in any software.
 <a name="I_have_a_closed_source_program"></a><h3>6.2 I have a closed-source program, can I use the libcurl library?</h3>
<p>  Yes!
<p>  libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the library.
<a name="I_have_a_BSD_licensed_program_c"></a><h3>6.3 I have a BSD licensed program, can I use the libcurl library?</h3>
<p>  Yes!
<p>  libcurl does not put any restrictions on the program that uses the library.
<a name="I_have_a_program_that_uses_LGPL"></a><h3>6.4 I have a program that uses LGPL libraries, can I use libcurl?</h3>
<p>  Yes!
<p>  The LGPL license doesn't clash with other licenses.
<a name="Can_I_modify_curl_libcurl_for_my"></a><h3>6.5 Can I modify curl/libcurl for my program and keep the changes secret?</h3>
<p>  Yes!
<p>  The MIT/X derivate license practically allows you to do almost anything with
   the sources, on the condition that the copyright texts in the sources are
    left intact.
 <a name="Can_you_please_change_the_curl_l"></a><h3>6.6 Can you please change the curl/libcurl license to XXXX?</h3>
<p>  No.
<p>  We have carefully picked this license after years of development and
   discussions and a large amount of people have contributed with source code
    knowing that this is the license we use. This license puts the restrictions
    we want on curl/libcurl and it does not spread to other programs or
    libraries that use it. It should be possible for everyone to use libcurl or
    curl in their projects, no matter what license they already have in use.
 <a name="What_are_my_obligations_when_usi"></a><h3>6.7 What are my obligations when using libcurl in my commercial apps?</h3>
<p>  Next to none. All you need to adhere to is the MIT-style license (stated in
   the COPYING file) which basically says you have to include the copyright
    notice in "all copies" and that you may not use the copyright holder's name
    when promoting your software.
 <p>  You do not have to release any of your source code.
<p>  You do not have to reveal or make public any changes to the libcurl source
   code.
 <p>  You do not have to broadcast to the world that you are using libcurl within
   your app.
 <p>  All we ask is that you disclose "the copyright notice and this permission
   notice" somewhere. Most probably like in the documentation or in the section
    where other third party dependencies already are mentioned and acknowledged.
 <p>  As can be seen here: <a href="companies.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/companies.html</a> and elsewhere,
   more and more companies are discovering the power of libcurl and take
    advantage of it even in commercial environments.
 <h2>7. PHP/CURL Issues</h2><a name="What_is_PHP_CURL"></a><h3>7.1 What is PHP/CURL?</h3>
<p>  The module for PHP that makes it possible for PHP programs to access curl-
   functions from within PHP.
 <p>  In the cURL project we call this module PHP/CURL to differentiate it from
   curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. The PHP team however
    does not refer to it like this (for unknown reasons). They call it plain
    CURL (often using all caps) or sometimes ext/curl, but both cause much
    confusion to users which in turn gives us a higher question load.
 <a name="Who_wrote_PHP_CURL"></a><h3>7.2 Who wrote PHP/CURL?</h3>
<p>  PHP/CURL was initially written by Sterling Hughes.
<a name="Can_I_perform_multiple_requests"></a><h3>7.3 Can I perform multiple requests using the same handle?</h3>
<p>  Yes - at least in PHP version 4.3.8 and later (this has been known to not
   work in earlier versions, but the exact version when it started to work is
    unknown to me).
 <p>  After a transfer, you just set new options in the handle and make another
   transfer. This will make libcurl re-use the same connection if it can.
 <p>  7.4 Does PHP/CURL have dependencies?
<p>  PHP/CURL is a module that comes with the regular PHP package. It depends on
   and uses libcurl, so you need to have libcurl installed properly before
    PHP/CURL can be used.
