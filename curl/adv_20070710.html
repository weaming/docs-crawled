         libcurl GnuTLS insufficient cert verification Vulnerability
         ===========================================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, July 10th 2007
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
libcurl (when built to use GnuTLS) fails to verify that a peer's certificate
hasn't already expired or hasn't yet become valid. This allows malicious
servers to present certificates to libcurl that won't be rejected properly.
&nbsp;
Notably, the cacert and common name checks are still in place which reduces
the risk for random servers to take advantage of this flaw.
&nbsp;
There is no known exploit at the time of this writing.
&nbsp;
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2007-3564 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
Affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.14.0 to and including 7.16.3
Not affected versions: curl and libcurl 7.13.2 and earlier, 7.16.4 and later
&nbsp;
Note that libcurl needs to be built to use GnuTLS for this flaw to be in
effect.
&nbsp;
Also note that (lib)curl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.
&nbsp;
3. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:
&nbsp;
 I - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.16.4
&nbsp;
 II - Apply the patch http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-gnutlscert.patch to your
      libcurl version and install this
&nbsp;
 III - Build curl with SSL provided by another library, like OpenSSL or NSS
&nbsp;
 IV  - Build curl with SSL disabled
&nbsp;
4. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
We were notified by Kees Cook on June 27th, 2007. His notification email
contained a valid patch.
&nbsp;
We agreed on and coordinated the synchronous disclosure of this problem
together with the curl 7.16.4 release.
&nbsp;
curl 7.16.4 was released on July 10 2007, just before this flaw was publicly
disclosed.
&nbsp;
5. CREDITS
&nbsp;
Reported to us by Kees Cook. Thanks a lot!
