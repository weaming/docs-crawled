                  libcurl cert name check ignore with GnuTLS
                  ==========================================
&nbsp;
Project cURL Security Advisory, December 17th 2013
<a href="security.html">http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html</a>
&nbsp;
1. VULNERABILITY
&nbsp;
  (This issue is almost identical to the one named 20131115 / CVE-2013-4545,
  but this problem affects a different SSL backend.)
&nbsp;
  libcurl is vulnerable to a case of missing out the checking of the
  certificate CN or SAN name field when the digital signature verification is
  turned off.
&nbsp;
  libcurl offers two separate and independent options for verifying a server's
  TLS certificate. CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST. The
  first one tells libcurl to verify the trust chain using a CA cert bundle,
  while the second tells libcurl to make sure that the name fields in the
  server certificate meets the criteria. Both options are enabled by default.
&nbsp;
  This flaw had the effect that when an application disabled
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, libcurl mistakenly also skipped the
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check. Applications can disable
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and still achieve security by doing the check on its
  own using other means.
&nbsp;
  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it either
  enables both options or disables both at the same time.
&nbsp;
  There are no known exploits available at this time.
&nbsp;
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2013-6422 to this issue.
&nbsp;
2. AFFECTED VERSIONS
&nbsp;
  This flaw only exists in the TLS backend that uses GnuTLS. If libcurl is
  built with another TLS backend, it isn't affected.
&nbsp;
  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.21.4 to and including 7.33.0
  Not affected versions: libcurl before 7.21.4 and &gt;= 7.34.0
&nbsp;
  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!
&nbsp;
3. THE SOLUTION
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.34.0 makes sure that both options independently will cause the
  operation to fail unless the criteria is fulfilled.
&nbsp;
  A patch for this is available at:
&nbsp;
    <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/cve-2013-6422.patch">http://curl.haxx.se/cve-2013-6422.patch</a>
&nbsp;
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
&nbsp;
  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:
&nbsp;
  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.34.0
&nbsp;
  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl
&nbsp;
  C - Make sure CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER is not disabled
&nbsp;
  D - Build libcurl with another TLS backend than GnuTLS
&nbsp;
5. TIME LINE
&nbsp;
  Vulnerability reported by Marc Deslauriers.
&nbsp;
  It was reported to the curl project on November 29th 2013. We contacted
  distros@openwall on December 3rd.
&nbsp;
  libcurl 7.34.0 was released on December 17th 2013, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
