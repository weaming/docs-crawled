<h1>libcurl/darwinssl certificate check bypass</h1>
<p>Project cURL Security Advisory, January 8th 2015 -
<a href="adv_20150108A.html">Permalink</a></p>
<h2>VULNERABILITY</h2>
<p>libcurl stores TLS Session IDs in its associated Session ID cache when it
connects to TLS servers. In subsequent connects it re-uses the entry in the
cache to resume the TLS connection faster than when doing a full TLS
handshake. The actual implementation for the Session ID caching varies
depending on the underlying TLS backend.</p>
<p>libcurl allows applications to switch off certificate verification in two
different ways - using <code>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</code> and <code>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</code>.</p>
<p>When an application connected to a TLS server with certificate verification
disabled, it would store the Session ID in the cache and if then a subsequent
connection was made against the same host and port number, it would re-use the
former session and thanks to the the re-used session from the cache, it would
skip the certificate check and wrongly accept any bad certificate that could
be presented.</p>
<p>The problem was that the "key" used for caching Session IDs didn't take the
ceritificate check status into account.</p>
<p>This problem is specific to libcurl built to use the DarwinSSL back-end for
TLS, so it can only affect Mac and iPhone based applications.</p>
<p>We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.</p>
<p>DarwinSSL is also known as SecureTransport.</p>
<h2>INFO</h2>
<p>This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation
series is made with that.</p>
<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2014-8151 to this issue.</p>
<h2>AFFECTED VERSIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Affected versions: from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.39.0</li>
<li>Not affected versions: libcurl &lt; 7.31.0 or >= 7.40.0</li>
</ul>
<p>libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!</p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>libcurl 7.40.0 makes sure that the certificate check status is used in the key
set for the Session ID and thus it cannot re-use IDs between checked and
unchecked TLS connections.</p>
<p>A patch for this problem is available at:</p>
<pre><code>http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2014-8151.patch
</code></pre>
<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<p>We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:</p>
<p>A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.40.0</p>
<p>B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl</p>
<p>C - Avoid disabling the server certificate checks when using TLS</p>
<h2>TIME LINE</h2>
<p>It was first reported to the curl project on November 26 2014.</p>
<p>We contacted Apple Product Security on December 17. We contacted
distros@openwall on December 28.</p>
<p>libcurl 7.40.0 was released on January 8th 2015, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.</p>
