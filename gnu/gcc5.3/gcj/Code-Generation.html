<h3 class="section">1.6 Code Generation</h3>

<p>In addition to the many <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> options controlling code generation,
<samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> has several options specific to itself.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-C</code><dd>This option is used to tell <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> to generate bytecode
(<samp><span class="file">.class</span></samp> files) rather than object code.

     <br><dt><code>--resource </code><var>resource-name</var><dd>This option is used to tell <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> to compile the contents of a
given file to object code so it may be accessed at runtime with the core
protocol handler as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">core:/</span><var>resource-name</var></samp>&rsquo;.  Note that
<var>resource-name</var> is the name of the resource as found at runtime; for
instance, it could be used in a call to <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code>. 
The actual file name to be compiled this way must be specified
separately.

     <br><dt><code>-ftarget=</code><var>VERSION</var><dd>This can be used with <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp> to choose the version of bytecode
emitted by <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp>.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.5</span></samp>&rsquo;.  When not
generating bytecode, this option has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>-d </code><var>directory</var><dd>When used with <code>-C</code>, this causes all generated <samp><span class="file">.class</span></samp> files
to be put in the appropriate subdirectory of <var>directory</var>.  By
default they will be put in subdirectories of the current working
directory.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-bounds-check</code><dd>By default, <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> generates code which checks the bounds of all
array indexing operations.  With this option, these checks are omitted, which
can improve performance for code that uses arrays extensively.  Note that this
can result in unpredictable behavior if the code in question actually does
violate array bounds constraints.  It is safe to use this option if you are
sure that your code will never throw an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-store-check</code><dd>Don't generate array store checks.  When storing objects into arrays, a runtime
check is normally generated in order to ensure that the object is assignment
compatible with the component type of the array (which may not be known
at compile-time).  With this option, these checks are omitted.  This can
improve performance for code which stores objects into arrays frequently. 
It is safe to use this option if you are sure your code will never throw an
<code>ArrayStoreException</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fjni</code><dd>With <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> there are two options for writing native methods: CNI
and JNI.  By default <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> assumes you are using CNI.  If you are
compiling a class with native methods, and these methods are implemented
using JNI, then you must use <code>-fjni</code>.  This option causes
<samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> to generate stubs which will invoke the underlying JNI
methods.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-assert</code><dd>Don't recognize the <code>assert</code> keyword.  This is for compatibility
with older versions of the language specification.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization</code><dd>When the optimization level is greater or equal to <code>-O2</code>,
<samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> will try to optimize the way calls into the runtime are made
to initialize static classes upon their first use (this optimization
isn't carried out if <code>-C</code> was specified.) When compiling to native
code, <code>-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization</code> will turn this
optimization off, regardless of the optimization level in use.

     <br><dt><code>--disable-assertions[=</code><var>class-or-package</var><code>]</code><dd>Don't include code for checking assertions in the compiled code. 
If <code>=</code><var>class-or-package</var> is missing disables assertion code
generation for all classes, unless overridden by a more
specific <code>--enable-assertions</code> flag. 
If <var>class-or-package</var> is a class name, only disables generating
assertion checks within the named class or its inner classes. 
If <var>class-or-package</var> is a package name, disables generating
assertion checks within the named package or a subpackage.

     <p>By default, assertions are enabled when generating class files
or when not optimizing, and disabled when generating optimized binaries.

     <br><dt><code>--enable-assertions[=</code><var>class-or-package</var><code>]</code><dd>Generates code to check assertions.  The option is perhaps misnamed,
as you still need to turn on assertion checking at run-time,
and we don't support any easy way to do that. 
So this flag isn't very useful yet, except to partially override
<code>--disable-assertions</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-findirect-dispatch</code><dd><samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> has a special binary compatibility ABI, which is enabled
by the <code>-findirect-dispatch</code> option.  In this mode, the code
generated by <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> honors the binary compatibility guarantees
in the Java Language Specification, and the resulting object files do
not need to be directly linked against their dependencies.  Instead,
all dependencies are looked up at runtime.  This allows free mixing of
interpreted and compiled code.

     <p>Note that, at present, <code>-findirect-dispatch</code> can only be used
when compiling <samp><span class="file">.class</span></samp> files.  It will not work when compiling
from source.  CNI also does not yet work with the binary compatibility
ABI.  These restrictions will be lifted in some future release.

     <p>However, if you compile CNI code with the standard ABI, you can call
it from code built with the binary compatibility ABI.

     <br><dt><code>-fbootstrap-classes</code><dd>This option can be use to tell <code>libgcj</code> that the compiled classes
should be loaded by the bootstrap loader, not the system class loader. 
By default, if you compile a class and link it into an executable, it
will be treated as if it was loaded using the system class loader. 
This is convenient, as it means that things like
<code>Class.forName()</code> will search &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CLASSPATH</span></samp>&rsquo; to find the
desired class.

     <br><dt><code>-freduced-reflection</code><dd>This option causes the code generated by <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> to contain a
reduced amount of the class meta-data used to support runtime
reflection. The cost of this savings is the loss of
the ability to use certain reflection capabilities of the standard
Java runtime environment. When set all meta-data except for that
which is needed to obtain correct runtime semantics is eliminated.

     <p>For code that does not use reflection (i.e. serialization, RMI, CORBA
or call methods in the <code>java.lang.reflect</code> package),
<code>-freduced-reflection</code> will result in proper operation with a
savings in executable code size.

     <p>JNI (<code>-fjni</code>) and the binary compatibility ABI
(<code>-findirect-dispatch</code>) do not work properly without full
reflection meta-data.  Because of this, it is an error to use these options
with <code>-freduced-reflection</code>.

     <p><strong>Caution:</strong> If there is no reflection meta-data, code that uses
a <code>SecurityManager</code> may not work properly.  Also calling
<code>Class.forName()</code> may fail if the calling method has no
reflection meta-data.
