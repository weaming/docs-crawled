<h3 class="section">11.7 Class Initialization</h3>

<p>Java requires that each class be automatically initialized at the time
of the first active use.  Initializing a class involves
initializing the static fields, running code in class initializer
methods, and initializing base classes.  There may also be
some implementation specific actions, such as allocating
<code>String</code> objects corresponding to string literals in
the code.

   <p>The GCJ compiler inserts calls to <code>JvInitClass</code> at appropriate
places to ensure that a class is initialized when required.  The C++
compiler does not insert these calls automatically&mdash;it is the
programmer's responsibility to make sure classes are initialized. 
However, this is fairly painless because of the conventions assumed by
the Java system.

   <p>First, <code>libgcj</code> will make sure a class is initialized before an
instance of that object is created.  This is one of the
responsibilities of the <code>new</code> operation.  This is taken care of
both in Java code, and in C++ code.  When G++ sees a <code>new</code> of a
Java class, it will call a routine in <code>libgcj</code> to allocate the
object, and that routine will take care of initializing the class. 
Note however that this does not happen for Java arrays; you must
allocate those using the appropriate CNI function.  It follows that
you can access an instance field, or call an instance (non-static)
method and be safe in the knowledge that the class and all of its base
classes have been initialized.

   <p>Invoking a static method is also safe.  This is because the
Java compiler adds code to the start of a static method to make sure
the class is initialized.  However, the C++ compiler does not
add this extra code.  Hence, if you write a native static method
using CNI, you are responsible for calling <code>JvInitClass</code>
before doing anything else in the method (unless you are sure
it is safe to leave it out).

   <p>Accessing a static field also requires the class of the
field to be initialized.  The Java compiler will generate code
to call <code>JvInitClass</code> before getting or setting the field. 
However, the C++ compiler will not generate this extra code,
so it is your responsibility to make sure the class is
initialized before you access a static field from C++.
