<h3 class="section">2.2 Extra features unique to gcj</h3>

<p>The main feature of <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> is that it can compile programs written in
the Java programming language to native code.  Most extensions that have been
added are to facilitate this functionality.

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> makes it easy and efficient to mix code written in Java and C++. 
See <a href="About-CNI.html#About-CNI">About CNI</a>, for more info on how to use this in your programs.

     <li>When you compile your classes into a shared library using
<code>-findirect-dispatch</code> then add them to the system-wide
classmap.db file using <code>gcj-dbtool</code>, they will be automatically
loaded by the <code>libgcj</code> system classloader.  This is the new,
preferred classname-to-library resolution mechanism.  See <a href="Invoking-gcj_002ddbtool.html#Invoking-gcj_002ddbtool">Invoking gcj-dbtool</a>, for more information on using the classmap database.

     <li>The old classname-to-library lookup mechanism is still supported
through the <code>gnu.gcj.runtime.VMClassLoader.library_control</code>
property, but it is deprecated and will likely be removed in some
future release.  When trying to load a class <code>gnu.pkg.SomeClass</code>
the system classloader will first try to load the shared library
<samp><span class="file">lib-gnu-pkg-SomeClass.so</span></samp>, if that fails to load the class then
it will try to load <samp><span class="file">lib-gnu-pkg.so</span></samp> and finally when the class
is still not loaded it will try to load <samp><span class="file">lib-gnu.so</span></samp>.  Note that
all &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;s will be transformed into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;s and that searching
for inner classes starts with their outermost outer class.  If the
class cannot be found this way the system classloader tries to use the
<code>libgcj</code> bytecode interpreter to load the class from the standard
classpath.  This process can be controlled to some degree via the
<code>gnu.gcj.runtime.VMClassLoader.library_control</code> property;
See <a href="libgcj-Runtime-Properties.html#libgcj-Runtime-Properties">libgcj Runtime Properties</a>.

     <li><code>libgcj</code> includes a special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcjlib</span></samp>&rsquo; URL type.  A URL of
this form is like a <code>jar</code> URL, and looks like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gcjlib:/path/to/shared/library.so!/path/to/resource</span></samp>&rsquo;.  An access
to one of these URLs causes the shared library to be <code>dlopen()</code>d,
and then the resource is looked for in that library.  These URLs are
most useful when used in conjunction with <code>java.net.URLClassLoader</code>. 
Note that, due to implementation limitations, currently any such URL
can be accessed by only one class loader, and libraries are never
unloaded.  This means some care must be exercised to make sure that
a <code>gcjlib</code> URL is not accessed by more than one class loader at once. 
In a future release this limitation will be lifted, and such
libraries will be mapped privately.

     <li>A program compiled by <samp><span class="command">gcj</span></samp> will examine the
<samp><span class="env">GCJ_PROPERTIES</span></samp> environment variable and change its behavior in
some ways.  In particular <samp><span class="env">GCJ_PROPERTIES</span></samp> holds a list of
assignments to global properties, such as would be set with the
<samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> option to <samp><span class="command">java</span></samp>.  For instance,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">java.compiler=gcj</span></samp>&rsquo; is a valid (but currently meaningless)
setting.
