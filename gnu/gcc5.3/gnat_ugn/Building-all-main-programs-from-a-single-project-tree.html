<h4 class="subsection">5.7.1 Building all main programs from a single project tree</h4>

<p>Most often, an application is organized into modules and submodules,
which are very conveniently represented as a project tree or graph
(the root project A `with's the projects for each modules (say B and C),
which in turn `with' projects for submodules.

<p>Very often, modules will build their own executables (for testing
purposes for instance), or libraries (for easier reuse in various
contexts).

<p>However, if you build your project through `gnatmake' or
`gprbuild', using a syntax similar to

<pre class="example">    gprbuild -PA.gpr
</pre>
<p>this will only rebuild the main programs of project A, not those of the
imported projects B and C. Therefore you have to spawn several
`gnatmake' commands, one per project, to build all executables. 
This is a little inconvenient, but more importantly is inefficient
because `gnatmake' needs to do duplicate work to ensure that sources are
up-to-date, and cannot easily compile things in parallel when using
the -j switch.

<p>Also libraries are always rebuilt when building a project.

<p>You could therefore define an aggregate project Agg that groups A, B
and C. Then, when you build with

<pre class="example">    gprbuild -PAgg.gpr
</pre>
<p>this will build all mains from A, B and C.

<pre class="example">    aggregate project Agg is
       for Project_Files use ("a.gpr", "b.gpr", "c.gpr");
    end Agg;
</pre>
<p>If B or C do not define any main program (through their Main
attribute), all their sources are built. When you do not group them
in the aggregate project, only those sources that are needed by A
will be built.

<p>If you add a main to a project P not already explicitly referenced in the
aggregate project, you will need to add "p.gpr" in the list of project
files for the aggregate project, or the main will not be built when
building the aggregate project.

<p>Aggregate projects are supported only with `gprbuild', not with
`gnatmake'.
