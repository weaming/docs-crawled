<h3 class="section">11.3 Controlling the Elaboration Order</h3>

<p>In the previous section we discussed the rules in Ada which ensure
that <cite>Program_Error</cite> is raised if an incorrect elaboration order is
chosen. This prevents erroneous executions, but we need mechanisms to
specify a correct execution and avoid the exception altogether. 
To achieve this, Ada provides a number of features for controlling
the order of elaboration. We discuss these features in this section.

<p>First, there are several ways of indicating to the compiler that a given
unit has no elaboration problems:

     <ul>
<li>`packages that do not require a body'

     <p>A library package that does not require a body does not permit
a body (this rule was introduced in Ada 95). 
Thus if we have a such a package, as in:

     <pre class="example">         package Definitions is
            generic
               type m is new integer;
            package Subp is
               type a is array (1 .. 10) of m;
               type b is array (1 .. 20) of m;
            end Subp;
         end Definitions;
</pre>
     <p>A package that `with's <cite>Definitions</cite> may safely instantiate
<cite>Definitions.Subp</cite> because the compiler can determine that there
definitely is no package body to worry about in this case
</ul>

<p><a name="index-pragma-Pure-1144"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`pragma Pure'

     <p>This pragma places sufficient restrictions on a unit to guarantee that
no call to any subprogram in the unit can result in an
elaboration problem. This means that the compiler does not need
to worry about the point of elaboration of such units, and in
particular, does not need to check any calls to any subprograms
in this unit. 
</ul>

<p><a name="index-pragma-Preelaborate-1145"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`pragma Preelaborate'

     <p>This pragma places slightly less stringent restrictions on a unit than
does pragma Pure,
but these restrictions are still sufficient to ensure that there
are no elaboration problems with any calls to the unit. 
</ul>

<p><a name="index-pragma-Elaborate_005fBody-1146"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`pragma Elaborate_Body'

     <p>This pragma requires that the body of a unit be elaborated immediately
after its spec. Suppose a unit <cite>A</cite> has such a pragma,
and unit <cite>B</cite> does
a `with' of unit <cite>A</cite>. Recall that the standard rules require
the spec of unit <cite>A</cite>
to be elaborated before the `with'ing unit; given the pragma in
<cite>A</cite>, we also know that the body of <cite>A</cite>
will be elaborated before <cite>B</cite>, so
that calls to <cite>A</cite> are safe and do not need a check.

     <p>Note that, unlike pragma <cite>Pure</cite> and pragma <cite>Preelaborate</cite>,
the use of <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite> does not guarantee that the program is
free of elaboration problems, because it may not be possible
to satisfy the requested elaboration order. 
Let's go back to the example with <cite>Unit_1</cite> and <cite>Unit_2</cite>. 
If a programmer marks <cite>Unit_1</cite> as <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite>,
and not <cite>Unit_2,</cite> then the order of
elaboration will be:

     <pre class="example">         Spec of Unit_2
         Spec of Unit_1
         Body of Unit_1
         Body of Unit_2
</pre>
     <p>Now that means that the call to <cite>Func_1</cite> in <cite>Unit_2</cite>
need not be checked,
it must be safe. But the call to <cite>Func_2</cite> in
<cite>Unit_1</cite> may still fail if
<cite>Expression_1</cite> is equal to 1,
and the programmer must still take
responsibility for this not being the case.

     <p>If all units carry a pragma <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite>, then all problems are
eliminated, except for calls entirely within a body, which are
in any case fully under programmer control. However, using the pragma
everywhere is not always possible. 
In particular, for our <cite>Unit_1</cite>/<cite>Unit_2</cite> example, if
we marked both of them as having pragma <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite>, then
clearly there would be no possible elaboration order. 
</ul>

<p>The above pragmas allow a server to guarantee safe use by clients, and
clearly this is the preferable approach. Consequently a good rule
is to mark units as <cite>Pure</cite> or <cite>Preelaborate</cite> if possible,
and if this is not possible,
mark them as <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite> if possible. 
As we have seen, there are situations where neither of these
three pragmas can be used. 
So we also provide methods for clients to control the
order of elaboration of the servers on which they depend:

<p><a name="index-pragma-Elaborate-1147"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`pragma Elaborate (unit)'

     <p>This pragma is placed in the context clause, after a `with' clause,
and it requires that the body of the named unit be elaborated before
the unit in which the pragma occurs. The idea is to use this pragma
if the current unit calls at elaboration time, directly or indirectly,
some subprogram in the named unit. 
</ul>

<p><a name="index-pragma-Elaborate_005fAll-1148"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`pragma Elaborate_All (unit)'

     <p>This is a stronger version of the Elaborate pragma. Consider the
following example:

     <pre class="example">         Unit A |withs| unit B and calls B.Func in elab code
         Unit B |withs| unit C, and B.Func calls C.Func
</pre>
     <p>Now if we put a pragma <cite>Elaborate (B)</cite>
in unit <cite>A</cite>, this ensures that the
body of <cite>B</cite> is elaborated before the call, but not the
body of <cite>C</cite>, so
the call to <cite>C.Func</cite> could still cause <cite>Program_Error</cite> to
be raised.

     <p>The effect of a pragma <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> is stronger, it requires
not only that the body of the named unit be elaborated before the
unit doing the `with', but also the bodies of all units that the
named unit uses, following `with' links transitively. For example,
if we put a pragma <cite>Elaborate_All (B)</cite> in unit <cite>A</cite>,
then it requires not only that the body of <cite>B</cite> be elaborated before <cite>A</cite>,
but also the body of <cite>C</cite>, because <cite>B</cite> `with's <cite>C</cite>. 
</ul>

<p>We are now in a position to give a usage rule in Ada for avoiding
elaboration problems, at least if dynamic dispatching and access to
subprogram values are not used. We will handle these cases separately
later.

<p>The rule is simple:

<p>`If a unit has elaboration code that can directly or
indirectly make a call to a subprogram in a |withed| unit, or instantiate
a generic package in a |withed| unit,
then if the |withed| unit does not have
pragma `Pure` or `Preelaborate`, then the client should have
a pragma `Elaborate_All`for the |withed| unit.*'

<p>By following this rule a client is
assured that calls can be made without risk of an exception.

<p>For generic subprogram instantiations, the rule can be relaxed to
require only a pragma <cite>Elaborate</cite> since elaborating the body
of a subprogram cannot cause any transitive elaboration (we are
not calling the subprogram in this case, just elaborating its
declaration).

<p>If this rule is not followed, then a program may be in one of four
states:

     <ul>
<li>`No order exists'

     <p>No order of elaboration exists which follows the rules, taking into
account any <cite>Elaborate</cite>, <cite>Elaborate_All</cite>,
or <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite> pragmas. In
this case, an Ada compiler must diagnose the situation at bind
time, and refuse to build an executable program.

     <li>`One or more orders exist, all incorrect'

     <p>One or more acceptable elaboration orders exist, and all of them
generate an elaboration order problem. In this case, the binder
can build an executable program, but <cite>Program_Error</cite> will be raised
when the program is run.

     <li>`Several orders exist, some right, some incorrect'

     <p>One or more acceptable elaboration orders exists, and some of them
work, and some do not. The programmer has not controlled
the order of elaboration, so the binder may or may not pick one of
the correct orders, and the program may or may not raise an
exception when it is run. This is the worst case, because it means
that the program may fail when moved to another compiler, or even
another version of the same compiler.

     <li>`One or more orders exists, all correct'

     <p>One ore more acceptable elaboration orders exist, and all of them
work. In this case the program runs successfully. This state of
affairs can be guaranteed by following the rule we gave above, but
may be true even if the rule is not followed. 
</ul>

<p>Note that one additional advantage of following our rules on the use
of <cite>Elaborate</cite> and <cite>Elaborate_All</cite>
is that the program continues to stay in the ideal (all orders OK) state
even if maintenance
changes some bodies of some units. Conversely, if a program that does
not follow this rule happens to be safe at some point, this state of affairs
may deteriorate silently as a result of maintenance changes.

<p>You may have noticed that the above discussion did not mention
the use of <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite>. This was a deliberate omission. If you
`with' an <cite>Elaborate_Body</cite> unit, it still may be the case that
code in the body makes calls to some other unit, so it is still necessary
to use <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> on such units.
