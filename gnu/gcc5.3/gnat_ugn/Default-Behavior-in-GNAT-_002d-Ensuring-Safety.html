<h3 class="section">11.6 Default Behavior in GNAT - Ensuring Safety</h3>

<p>The default behavior in GNAT ensures elaboration safety. In its
default mode GNAT implements the
rule we previously described as the right approach. Let's restate it:

<p>`If a unit has elaboration code that can directly or indirectly make a
call to a subprogram in a |withed| unit, or instantiate a generic
package in a |withed| unit, then if the |withed| unit
does not have pragma `Pure` or `Preelaborate`, then the client should have an
`Elaborate_All` pragma for the |withed| unit.'

<p>`In the case of instantiating a generic subprogram, it is always
sufficient to have only an `Elaborate` pragma for the
|withed| unit.'

<p>By following this rule a client is assured that calls and instantiations
can be made without risk of an exception.

<p>In this mode GNAT traces all calls that are potentially made from
elaboration code, and puts in any missing implicit <cite>Elaborate</cite>
and <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas. 
The advantage of this approach is that no elaboration problems
are possible if the binder can find an elaboration order that is
consistent with these implicit <cite>Elaborate</cite> and
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas. The
disadvantage of this approach is that no such order may exist.

<p>If the binder does not generate any diagnostics, then it means that it has
found an elaboration order that is guaranteed to be safe. However, the binder
may still be relying on implicitly generated <cite>Elaborate</cite> and
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas so portability to other compilers than GNAT is not
guaranteed.

<p>If it is important to guarantee portability, then the compilations should
use the `-gnatel'
(info messages for elaboration pragmas) switch. This will cause info messages
to be generated indicating the missing <cite>Elaborate</cite> and
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas. 
Consider the following source program:

<pre class="example">    with k;
    package j is
      m : integer := k.r;
    end;
</pre>
<p>where it is clear that there
should be a pragma <cite>Elaborate_All</cite>
for unit <cite>k</cite>. An implicit pragma will be generated, and it is
likely that the binder will be able to honor it. However, if you want
to port this program to some other Ada compiler than GNAT. 
it is safer to include the pragma explicitly in the source. If this
unit is compiled with the `-gnatel'
switch, then the compiler outputs an information message:

<pre class="example">    1. with k;
    2. package j is
    3.   m : integer := k.r;
                         |
       &gt;&gt;&gt; info: call to "r" may raise Program_Error
       &gt;&gt;&gt; info: missing pragma Elaborate_All for "k"
    
    4. end;
</pre>
<p>and these messages can be used as a guide for supplying manually
the missing pragmas. It is usually a bad idea to use this
option during development. That's because it will tell you when
you need to put in a pragma, but cannot tell you when it is time
to take it out. So the use of pragma <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> may lead to
unnecessary dependencies and even false circularities.

<p>This default mode is more restrictive than the Ada Reference
Manual, and it is possible to construct programs which will compile
using the dynamic model described there, but will run into a
circularity using the safer static model we have described.

<p>Of course any Ada compiler must be able to operate in a mode
consistent with the requirements of the Ada Reference Manual,
and in particular must have the capability of implementing the
standard dynamic model of elaboration with run-time checks.

<p>In GNAT, this standard mode can be achieved either by the use of
the `-gnatE' switch on the compiler (`gcc' or
`gnatmake') command, or by the use of the configuration pragma:

<pre class="example">    pragma Elaboration_Checks (DYNAMIC);
</pre>
<p>Either approach will cause the unit affected to be compiled using the
standard dynamic run-time elaboration checks described in the Ada
Reference Manual. The static model is generally preferable, since it
is clearly safer to rely on compile and link time checks rather than
run-time checks. However, in the case of legacy code, it may be
difficult to meet the requirements of the static model. This
issue is further discussed in
<a href="2bc.html#g_t2bc">What to Do If the Default Elaboration Behavior Fails</a>.

<p>Note that the static model provides a strict subset of the allowed
behavior and programs of the Ada Reference Manual, so if you do
adhere to the static model and no circularities exist,
then you are assured that your program will
work using the dynamic model, providing that you remove any
pragma Elaborate statements from the source.
