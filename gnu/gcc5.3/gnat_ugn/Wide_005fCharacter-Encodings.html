<h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 Wide_Character Encodings</h4>

<p>GNAT allows wide character codes to appear in character and string
literals, and also optionally in identifiers, by means of the following
possible encoding schemes:

     <dl>
<dt>`Hex Coding'<dd>
In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following five
character sequence:

     <pre class="example">         ESC a b c d
</pre>
     <p>where <cite>a</cite>, <cite>b</cite>, <cite>c</cite>, <cite>d</cite> are the four hexadecimal
characters (using uppercase letters) of the wide character code. For
example, ESC A345 is used to represent the wide character with code
<cite>16#A345#</cite>. 
This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set.

     <br><dt>`Upper-Half Coding'<dd>
<a name="index-Upper_002dHalf-Coding-33"></a>
The wide character with encoding <cite>16#abcd#</cite> where the upper bit is on
(in other words, 'a' is in the range 8-F) is represented as two bytes,
<cite>16#ab#</cite> and <cite>16#cd#</cite>. The second byte cannot be a format control
character, but is not required to be in the upper half. This method can
be also used for shift-JIS or EUC, where the internal coding matches the
external coding.

     <br><dt>`Shift JIS Coding'<dd>
<a name="index-Shift-JIS-Coding-34"></a>
A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence,
<cite>16#ab#</cite> and
<cite>16#cd#</cite>, with the restrictions described for upper-half encoding as
described above. The internal character code is the corresponding JIS
character according to the standard algorithm for Shift-JIS
conversion. Only characters defined in the JIS code set table can be
used with this encoding method.

     <br><dt>`EUC Coding'<dd>
<a name="index-EUC-Coding-35"></a>
A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence
<cite>16#ab#</cite> and
<cite>16#cd#</cite>, with both characters being in the upper half. The internal
character code is the corresponding JIS character according to the EUC
encoding algorithm. Only characters defined in the JIS code set table
can be used with this encoding method.

     <br><dt>`UTF-8 Coding'<dd>
A wide character is represented using
UCS Transformation Format 8 (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO
10646-1/Am.2. Depending on the character value, the representation
is a one, two, or three byte sequence:

     <pre class="example">         16#0000#-16#007f#: 2#0`xxxxxxx`#
         16#0080#-16#07ff#: 2#110`xxxxx`# 2#10`xxxxxx`#
         16#0800#-16#ffff#: 2#1110`xxxx`# 2#10`xxxxxx`# 2#10`xxxxxx`#
</pre>
     <p>where the <cite>xxx</cite> bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
16-bit character value. Note that all lower half ASCII characters
are represented as ASCII bytes and all upper half characters and
other wide characters are represented as sequences of upper-half
(The full UTF-8 scheme allows for encoding 31-bit characters as
6-byte sequences, and in the following section on wide wide
characters, the use of these sequences is documented).

     <br><dt>`Brackets Coding'<dd>
In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following eight
character sequence:

     <pre class="example">         [ " a b c d " ]
</pre>
     <p>where <cite>a</cite>, <cite>b</cite>, <cite>c</cite>, <cite>d</cite> are the four hexadecimal
characters (using uppercase letters) of the wide character code. For
example, ['A345'] is used to represent the wide character with code
<cite>16#A345#</cite>. It is also possible (though not required) to use the
Brackets coding for upper half characters. For example, the code
<cite>16#A3#</cite> can be represented as <cite>['A3']</cite>.

     <p>This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set,
and is also the method used for wide character encoding in some standard
ACATS (Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite) test suite distributions.
