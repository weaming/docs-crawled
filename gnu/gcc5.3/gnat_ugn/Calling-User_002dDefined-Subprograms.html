<h4 class="subsection">8.1.5 Calling User-Defined Subprograms</h4>

<p>An important capability of <cite>GDB</cite> is the ability to call user-defined
subprograms while debugging. This is achieved simply by entering
a subprogram call statement in the form:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    call subprogram-name (parameters)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The keyword <cite>call</cite> can be omitted in the normal case where the
<cite>subprogram-name</cite> does not coincide with any of the predefined
<cite>GDB</cite> commands.

<p>The effect is to invoke the given subprogram, passing it the
list of parameters that is supplied. The parameters can be expressions and
can include variables from the program being debugged. The
subprogram must be defined
at the library level within your program, and <cite>GDB</cite> will call the
subprogram within the environment of your program execution (which
means that the subprogram is free to access or even modify variables
within your program).

<p>The most important use of this facility is in allowing the inclusion of
debugging routines that are tailored to particular data structures
in your program. Such debugging routines can be written to provide a suitably
high-level description of an abstract type, rather than a low-level dump
of its physical layout. After all, the standard
<cite>GDB print</cite> command only knows the physical layout of your
types, not their abstract meaning. Debugging routines can provide information
at the desired semantic level and are thus enormously useful.

<p>For example, when debugging GNAT itself, it is crucial to have access to
the contents of the tree nodes used to represent the program internally. 
But tree nodes are represented simply by an integer value (which in turn
is an index into a table of nodes). 
Using the <cite>print</cite> command on a tree node would simply print this integer
value, which is not very useful. But the PN routine (defined in file
treepr.adb in the GNAT sources) takes a tree node as input, and displays
a useful high level representation of the tree node, which includes the
syntactic category of the node, its position in the source, the integers
that denote descendant nodes and parent node, as well as varied
semantic information. To study this example in more detail, you might want to
look at the body of the PN procedure in the stated file.

<p>Another useful application of this capability is to deal with situations of
complex data which are not handled suitably by GDB. For example, if you specify
Convention Fortran for a multi-dimensional array, GDB does not know that
the ordering of array elements has been switched and will not properly
address the array elements. In such a case, instead of trying to print the
elements directly from GDB, you can write a callable procedure that prints
the elements in the desired format.
