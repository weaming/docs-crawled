<h4 class="subsection">5.2.3 Object and Exec Directory</h4>

<p>The next step when writing a project is to indicate where the compiler should
put the object files. In fact, the compiler and other tools might create
several different kind of files (for GNAT, there is the object file and the ALI
file for instance). One of the important concepts in projects is that most
tools may consider source directories as read-only and do not attempt to create
new or temporary files there. Instead, all files are created in the object
directory. It is of course not true for project-aware IDEs, whose purpose it is
to create the source files.

<p><a name="index-Object_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-790"></a>
The object directory is specified through the `Object_Dir' attribute. 
Its value is the path to the object directory, either absolute or
relative to the directory containing the project file. This
directory must already exist and be readable and writable, although
some tools have a switch to create the directory if needed (See
the switch <cite>-p</cite> for `gnatmake'
and `gprbuild').

<p>If the attribute <cite>Object_Dir</cite> is not specified, it defaults to
the project directory, that is the directory containing the project file.

<p>For our example, we can specify the object dir in this way:

<!-- code-block: ada-project -->
<!-- project Build is -->
<!-- for Source_Dirs use ("common"); -->
<!-- for Object_Dir use "obj";   -  <<<< -->
<!-- end Build; -->
<p>As mentioned earlier, there is a single object directory per project. As a
result, if you have an existing system where the object files are spread across
several directories, you can either move all of them into the same directory if
you want to build it with a single project file, or study the section on
subsystems (see <a href="14e.html#g_t14e">Organizing Projects into Subsystems</a>) to see how each
separate object directory can be associated with one of the subsystems
constituting the application.

<p>When the `linker' is called, it usually creates an executable. By
default, this executable is placed in the object directory of the project. It
might be convenient to store it in its own directory.

<p><a name="index-Exec_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-791"></a>
This can be done through the <cite>Exec_Dir</cite> attribute, which, like
`Object_Dir' contains a single absolute or relative path and must point to
an existing and writable directory, unless you ask the tool to create it on
your behalf. When not specified, It defaults to the object directory and
therefore to the project file's directory if neither `Object_Dir' nor
`Exec_Dir' was specified.

<p>In the case of the example, let's place the executable in the root
of the hierarchy, ie the same directory as <code>build.gpr</code>. Hence
the project file is now

<!-- code-block: ada-project -->
<!-- project Build is -->
<!-- for Source_Dirs use ("common"); -->
<!-- for Object_Dir use "obj"; -->
<!-- for Exec_Dir use ".";  -   <<<< -->
<!-- end Build; -->
</body></html>
