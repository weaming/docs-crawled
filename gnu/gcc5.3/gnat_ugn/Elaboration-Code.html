<h3 class="section">11.1 Elaboration Code</h3>

<p>Ada provides rather general mechanisms for executing code at elaboration
time, that is to say before the main program starts executing. Such code arises
in three contexts:

     <ul>
<li>`Initializers for variables'

     <p>Variables declared at the library level, in package specs or bodies, can
require initialization that is performed at elaboration time, as in:

     <pre class="example">         Sqrt_Half : Float := Sqrt (0.5);
</pre>
     <li>`Package initialization code'

     <p>Code in a <cite>BEGIN-END</cite> section at the outer level of a package body is
executed as part of the package body elaboration code.

     <li>`Library level task allocators'

     <p>Tasks that are declared using task allocators at the library level
start executing immediately and hence can execute at elaboration time. 
</ul>

<p>Subprogram calls are possible in any of these contexts, which means that
any arbitrary part of the program may be executed as part of the elaboration
code. It is even possible to write a program which does all its work at
elaboration time, with a null main program, although stylistically this
would usually be considered an inappropriate way to structure
a program.

<p>An important concern arises in the context of elaboration code:
we have to be sure that it is executed in an appropriate order. What we
have is a series of elaboration code sections, potentially one section
for each unit in the program. It is important that these execute
in the correct order. Correctness here means that, taking the above
example of the declaration of <cite>Sqrt_Half</cite>,
if some other piece of
elaboration code references <cite>Sqrt_Half</cite>,
then it must run after the
section of elaboration code that contains the declaration of
<cite>Sqrt_Half</cite>.

<p>There would never be any order of elaboration problem if we made a rule
that whenever you `with' a unit, you must elaborate both the spec and body
of that unit before elaborating the unit doing the `with'ing:

<pre class="example">    with Unit_1;
    package Unit_2 is ...
</pre>
<p>would require that both the body and spec of <cite>Unit_1</cite> be elaborated
before the spec of <cite>Unit_2</cite>. However, a rule like that would be far too
restrictive. In particular, it would make it impossible to have routines
in separate packages that were mutually recursive.

<p>You might think that a clever enough compiler could look at the actual
elaboration code and determine an appropriate correct order of elaboration,
but in the general case, this is not possible. Consider the following
example.

<p>In the body of <cite>Unit_1</cite>, we have a procedure <cite>Func_1</cite>
that references
the variable <cite>Sqrt_1</cite>, which is declared in the elaboration code
of the body of <cite>Unit_1</cite>:

<pre class="example">    Sqrt_1 : Float := Sqrt (0.1);
</pre>
<p>The elaboration code of the body of <cite>Unit_1</cite> also contains:

<pre class="example">    if expression_1 = 1 then
       Q := Unit_2.Func_2;
    end if;
</pre>
<p><cite>Unit_2</cite> is exactly parallel,
it has a procedure <cite>Func_2</cite> that references
the variable <cite>Sqrt_2</cite>, which is declared in the elaboration code of
the body <cite>Unit_2</cite>:

<pre class="example">    Sqrt_2 : Float := Sqrt (0.1);
</pre>
<p>The elaboration code of the body of <cite>Unit_2</cite> also contains:

<pre class="example">    if expression_2 = 2 then
       Q := Unit_1.Func_1;
    end if;
</pre>
<p>Now the question is, which of the following orders of elaboration is
acceptable:

<pre class="example">    Spec of Unit_1
    Spec of Unit_2
    Body of Unit_1
    Body of Unit_2
</pre>
<p>or

<pre class="example">    Spec of Unit_2
    Spec of Unit_1
    Body of Unit_2
    Body of Unit_1
</pre>
<p>If you carefully analyze the flow here, you will see that you cannot tell
at compile time the answer to this question. 
If <cite>expression_1</cite> is not equal to 1,
and <cite>expression_2</cite> is not equal to 2,
then either order is acceptable, because neither of the function calls is
executed. If both tests evaluate to true, then neither order is acceptable
and in fact there is no correct order.

<p>If one of the two expressions is true, and the other is false, then one
of the above orders is correct, and the other is incorrect. For example,
if <cite>expression_1</cite> /= 1 and <cite>expression_2</cite> = 2,
then the call to <cite>Func_1</cite>
will occur, but not the call to <cite>Func_2.</cite>
This means that it is essential
to elaborate the body of <cite>Unit_1</cite> before
the body of <cite>Unit_2</cite>, so the first
order of elaboration is correct and the second is wrong.

<p>By making <cite>expression_1</cite> and <cite>expression_2</cite>
depend on input data, or perhaps
the time of day, we can make it impossible for the compiler or binder
to figure out which of these expressions will be true, and hence it
is impossible to guarantee a safe order of elaboration at run time.
