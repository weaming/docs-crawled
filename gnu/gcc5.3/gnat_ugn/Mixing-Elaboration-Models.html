<h3 class="section">11.9 Mixing Elaboration Models</h3>

<p>So far, we have assumed that the entire program is either compiled
using the dynamic model or static model, ensuring consistency. It
is possible to mix the two models, but rules have to be followed
if this mixing is done to ensure that elaboration checks are not
omitted.

<p>The basic rule is that
`a unit compiled with the static model cannot
be |withed| by a unit compiled with the dynamic model'. 
The reason for this is that in the static model, a unit assumes that
its clients guarantee to use (the equivalent of) pragma
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> so that no elaboration checks are required
in inner subprograms, and this assumption is violated if the
client is compiled with dynamic checks.

<p>The precise rule is as follows. A unit that is compiled with dynamic
checks can only `with' a unit that meets at least one of the
following criteria:

     <ul>
<li>The `with'ed unit is itself compiled with dynamic elaboration
checks (that is with the `-gnatE' switch.

     <li>The `with'ed unit is an internal GNAT implementation unit from
the System, Interfaces, Ada, or GNAT hierarchies.

     <li>The `with'ed unit has pragma Preelaborate or pragma Pure.

     <li>The `with'ing unit (that is the client) has an explicit pragma
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> for the `with'ed unit. 
</ul>

<p>If this rule is violated, that is if a unit with dynamic elaboration
checks `with's a unit that does not meet one of the above four
criteria, then the binder (<cite>gnatbind</cite>) will issue a warning
similar to that in the following example:

<pre class="example">    warning: "x.ads" has dynamic elaboration checks and with's
    warning:   "y.ads" which has static elaboration checks
</pre>
<p>These warnings indicate that the rule has been violated, and that as a result
elaboration checks may be missed in the resulting executable file. 
This warning may be suppressed using the `-ws' binder switch
in the usual manner.

<p>One useful application of this mixing rule is in the case of a subsystem
which does not itself `with' units from the remainder of the
application. In this case, the entire subsystem can be compiled with
dynamic checks to resolve a circularity in the subsystem, while
allowing the main application that uses this subsystem to be compiled
using the more reliable default static model.
