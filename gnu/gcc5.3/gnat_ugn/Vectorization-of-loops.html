<h5 class="subsubsection">8.3.1.7 Vectorization of loops</h5>

<p><a name="index-Optimization-Switches-1011"></a>
You can take advantage of the auto-vectorizer present in the `gcc'
back end to vectorize loops with GNAT.  The corresponding command line switch
is `-ftree-vectorize' but, as it is enabled by default at `-O3'
and other aggressive optimizations helpful for vectorization also are enabled
by default at this level, using `-O3' directly is recommended.

<p>You also need to make sure that the target architecture features a supported
SIMD instruction set.  For example, for the x86 architecture, you should at
least specify `-msse2' to get significant vectorization (but you don't
need to specify it for x86-64 as it is part of the base 64-bit architecture). 
Similarly, for the PowerPC architecture, you should specify `-maltivec'.

<p>The preferred loop form for vectorization is the <cite>for</cite> iteration scheme. 
Loops with a <cite>while</cite> iteration scheme can also be vectorized if they are
very simple, but the vectorizer will quickly give up otherwise.  With either
iteration scheme, the flow of control must be straight, in particular no
<cite>exit</cite> statement may appear in the loop body.  The loop may however
contain a single nested loop, if it can be vectorized when considered alone:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    A : array (1..4, 1..4) of Long_Float;
    S : array (1..4) of Long_Float;
    
    procedure Sum is
    begin
       for I in A'Range(1) loop
          for J in A'Range(2) loop
             S (I) := S (I) + A (I, J);
          end loop;
       end loop;
    end Sum;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The vectorizable operations depend on the targeted SIMD instruction set, but
the adding and some of the multiplying operators are generally supported, as
well as the logical operators for modular types.  Note that, in the former
case, enabling overflow checks, for example with `-gnato', totally
disables vectorization.  The other checks are not supposed to have the same
definitive effect, although compiling with `-gnatp' might well reveal
cases where some checks do thwart vectorization.

<p>Type conversions may also prevent vectorization if they involve semantics that
are not directly supported by the code generator or the SIMD instruction set. 
A typical example is direct conversion from floating-point to integer types. 
The solution in this case is to use the following idiom:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    Integer (S'Truncation (F))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>if <cite>S</cite> is the subtype of floating-point object <cite>F</cite>.

<p>In most cases, the vectorizable loops are loops that iterate over arrays. 
All kinds of array types are supported, i.e. constrained array types with
static bounds:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type Array_Type is array (1 .. 4) of Long_Float;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>constrained array types with dynamic bounds:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type Array_Type is array (1 .. Q.N) of Long_Float;
    
    type Array_Type is array (Q.K .. 4) of Long_Float;
    
    type Array_Type is array (Q.K .. Q.N) of Long_Float;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>or unconstrained array types:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type Array_Type is array (Positive range &lt;&gt;) of Long_Float;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of the generated code decreases when the dynamic aspect of the
array type increases, the worst code being generated for unconstrained array
types.  This is so because, the less information the compiler has about the
bounds of the array, the more fallback code it needs to generate in order to
fix things up at run time.

<p>It is possible to specify that a given loop should be subject to vectorization
preferably to other optimizations by means of pragma <cite>Loop_Optimize</cite>:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    pragma Loop_Optimize (Vector);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>placed immediately within the loop will convey the appropriate hint to the
compiler for this loop.

<p>It is also possible to help the compiler generate better vectorized code
for a given loop by asserting that there are no loop-carried dependencies
in the loop.  Consider for example the procedure:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type Arr is array (1 .. 4) of Long_Float;
    
    procedure Add (X, Y : not null access Arr; R : not null access Arr) is
    begin
      for I in Arr'Range loop
        R(I) := X(I) + Y(I);
      end loop;
    end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, the compiler cannot unconditionally vectorize the loop because
assigning to a component of the array designated by R in one iteration could
change the value read from the components of the array designated by X or Y
in a later iteration.  As a result, the compiler will generate two versions
of the loop in the object code, one vectorized and the other not vectorized,
as well as a test to select the appropriate version at run time.  This can
be overcome by another hint:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    pragma Loop_Optimize (Ivdep);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>placed immediately within the loop will tell the compiler that it can safely
omit the non-vectorized version of the loop as well as the run-time test.
