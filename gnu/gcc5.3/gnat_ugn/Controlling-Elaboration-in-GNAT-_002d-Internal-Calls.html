<h3 class="section">11.4 Controlling Elaboration in GNAT - Internal Calls</h3>

<p>In the case of internal calls, i.e., calls within a single package, the
programmer has full control over the order of elaboration, and it is up
to the programmer to elaborate declarations in an appropriate order. For
example writing:

<pre class="example">    function One return Float;
    
    Q : Float := One;
    
    function One return Float is
    begin
         return 1.0;
    end One;
</pre>
<p>will obviously raise <cite>Program_Error</cite> at run time, because function
One will be called before its body is elaborated. In this case GNAT will
generate a warning that the call will raise <cite>Program_Error</cite>:

<pre class="example">     1. procedure y is
     2.    function One return Float;
     3.
     4.    Q : Float := One;
                        |
        &gt;&gt;&gt; warning: cannot call "One" before body is elaborated
        &gt;&gt;&gt; warning: Program_Error will be raised at run time
    
     5.
     6.    function One return Float is
     7.    begin
     8.         return 1.0;
     9.    end One;
    10.
    11. begin
    12.    null;
    13. end;
</pre>
<p>Note that in this particular case, it is likely that the call is safe, because
the function <cite>One</cite> does not access any global variables. 
Nevertheless in Ada, we do not want the validity of the check to depend on
the contents of the body (think about the separate compilation case), so this
is still wrong, as we discussed in the previous sections.

<p>The error is easily corrected by rearranging the declarations so that the
body of <cite>One</cite> appears before the declaration containing the call
(note that in Ada 95 as well as later versions of the Ada standard,
declarations can appear in any order, so there is no restriction that
would prevent this reordering, and if we write:

<pre class="example">    function One return Float;
    
    function One return Float is
    begin
         return 1.0;
    end One;
    
    Q : Float := One;
</pre>
<p>then all is well, no warning is generated, and no
<cite>Program_Error</cite> exception
will be raised. 
Things are more complicated when a chain of subprograms is executed:

<pre class="example">    function A return Integer;
    function B return Integer;
    function C return Integer;
    
    function B return Integer is begin return A; end;
    function C return Integer is begin return B; end;
    
    X : Integer := C;
    
    function A return Integer is begin return 1; end;
</pre>
<p>Now the call to <cite>C</cite>
at elaboration time in the declaration of <cite>X</cite> is correct, because
the body of <cite>C</cite> is already elaborated,
and the call to <cite>B</cite> within the body of
<cite>C</cite> is correct, but the call
to <cite>A</cite> within the body of <cite>B</cite> is incorrect, because the body
of <cite>A</cite> has not been elaborated, so <cite>Program_Error</cite>
will be raised on the call to <cite>A</cite>. 
In this case GNAT will generate a
warning that <cite>Program_Error</cite> may be
raised at the point of the call. Let's look at the warning:

<pre class="example">     1. procedure x is
     2.    function A return Integer;
     3.    function B return Integer;
     4.    function C return Integer;
     5.
     6.    function B return Integer is begin return A; end;
                                                        |
        &gt;&gt;&gt; warning: call to "A" before body is elaborated may
                     raise Program_Error
        &gt;&gt;&gt; warning: "B" called at line 7
        &gt;&gt;&gt; warning: "C" called at line 9
    
     7.    function C return Integer is begin return B; end;
     8.
     9.    X : Integer := C;
    10.
    11.    function A return Integer is begin return 1; end;
    12.
    13. begin
    14.    null;
    15. end;
</pre>
<p>Note that the message here says 'may raise', instead of the direct case,
where the message says 'will be raised'. That's because whether
<cite>A</cite> is
actually called depends in general on run-time flow of control. 
For example, if the body of <cite>B</cite> said

<pre class="example">    function B return Integer is
    begin
       if some-condition-depending-on-input-data then
          return A;
       else
          return 1;
       end if;
    end B;
</pre>
<p>then we could not know until run time whether the incorrect call to A would
actually occur, so <cite>Program_Error</cite> might
or might not be raised. It is possible for a compiler to
do a better job of analyzing bodies, to
determine whether or not <cite>Program_Error</cite>
might be raised, but it certainly
couldn't do a perfect job (that would require solving the halting problem
and is provably impossible), and because this is a warning anyway, it does
not seem worth the effort to do the analysis. Cases in which it
would be relevant are rare.

<p>In practice, warnings of either of the forms given
above will usually correspond to
real errors, and should be examined carefully and eliminated. 
In the rare case where a warning is bogus, it can be suppressed by any of
the following methods:

     <ul>
<li>Compile with the `-gnatws' switch set

     <li>Suppress <cite>Elaboration_Check</cite> for the called subprogram

     <li>Use pragma <cite>Warnings_Off</cite> to turn warnings off for the call
</ul>

<p>For the internal elaboration check case,
GNAT by default generates the
necessary run-time checks to ensure
that <cite>Program_Error</cite> is raised if any
call fails an elaboration check. Of course this can only happen if a
warning has been issued as described above. The use of pragma
<cite>Suppress (Elaboration_Check)</cite> may (but is not guaranteed to) suppress
some of these checks, meaning that it may be possible (but is not
guaranteed) for a program to be able to call a subprogram whose body
is not yet elaborated, without raising a <cite>Program_Error</cite> exception.
