<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Project Dependencies</h4>

<p>GtkAda comes with its own project file (appropriately called
<code>gtkada.gpr</code>), and we will assume we have already built a project
called <code>logging.gpr</code> for the logging module. With the information provided
so far in <code>build.gpr</code>, building the application would fail with an error
indicating that the gtkada and logging units that are relied upon by the sources
of this project cannot be found.

<p>This is solved by adding the following `with' clauses at the beginning of our
project:

<pre class="example">    with "gtkada.gpr";
    with "a/b/logging.gpr";
    project Build is
      ...  --  as before
    end Build;
</pre>
<p><a name="index-Externally_005fBuilt-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-818"></a>
When such a project is compiled, `gprbuild' will automatically check
the other projects and recompile their sources when needed. It will also
recompile the sources from <cite>Build</cite> when needed, and finally create the
executable. In some cases, the implementation units needed to recompile a
project are not available, or come from some third party and you do not want to
recompile it yourself. In this case, set the attribute `Externally_Built' to
"true", indicating to the builder that this project can be assumed to be
up-to-date, and should not be considered for recompilation. In Ada, if the
sources of this externally built project were compiled with another version of
the compiler or with incompatible options, the binder will issue an error.

<p>The project's `with' clause has several effects. It provides source
visibility between projects during the compilation process. It also guarantees
that the necessary object files from <cite>Logging</cite> and <cite>GtkAda</cite> are
available when linking <cite>Build</cite>.

<p>As can be seen in this example, the syntax for importing projects is similar
to the syntax for importing compilation units in Ada. However, project files
use literal strings instead of names, and the `with' clause identifies
project files rather than packages.

<p>Each literal string after `with' is the path
(absolute or relative) to a project file. The <cite>.gpr</cite> extension is
optional, although we recommend adding it. If no extension is specified,
and no project file with the <code>.gpr</code> extension is found, then
the file is searched for exactly as written in the `with' clause,
that is with no extension.

<p>As mentioned above, the path after a `with' has to be a literal
string, and you cannot use concatenation, or lookup the value of external
variables to change the directories from which a project is loaded. 
A solution if you need something like this is to use aggregate projects
(see <a href="16e.html#g_t16e">Aggregate Projects</a>).

<p><a name="index-project-path-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-819"></a>
When a relative path or a base name is used, the
project files are searched relative to each of the directories in the
`project path'. This path includes all the directories found with the
following algorithm, in this order; the first matching file is used:

     <ul>
<li>First, the file is searched relative to the directory that contains the
current project file.

     <p><a name="index-GPR_005fPROJECT_005fPATH_005fFILE-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-820"></a>
<a name="index-GPR_005fPROJECT_005fPATH-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-821"></a>
<a name="index-ADA_005fPROJECT_005fPATH-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-822"></a>
<li>Then it is searched relative to all the directories specified in the
environment variables `GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE',
`GPR_PROJECT_PATH' and `ADA_PROJECT_PATH' (in that order) if they exist. 
The value of `GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE', when defined, is the path name of
a text file that contains project directory path names, one per line. 
`GPR_PROJECT_PATH' and `ADA_PROJECT_PATH', when defined, contain
project directory path names separated by directory separators. 
`ADA_PROJECT_PATH' is used for compatibility, it is recommended to
use `GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE' or `GPR_PROJECT_PATH'.

     <li>Finally, it is searched relative to the default project directories. 
Such directories depend on the tool used. The locations searched in the
specified order are:

          <ul>
<li><code>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;target&gt;/lib/gnat</code>
(for `gnatmake' in all cases, and for `gprbuild' if option
`&ndash;target' is specified)

          <li><code>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;target&gt;/share/gpr</code>
(for `gnatmake' in all cases, and for `gprbuild' if option
`&ndash;target' is specified)

          <li><code>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/gpr/</code>
(for `gnatmake' and `gprbuild')

          <li><code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/gnat/</code>
(for `gnatmake' and `gprbuild')
</ul>

     <p>In our example, <code>gtkada.gpr</code> is found in the predefined directory if
it was installed at the same root as GNAT. 
</ul>

<p>Some tools also support extending the project path from the command line,
generally through the `-aP'. You can see the value of the project
path by using the `gnatls -v' command.

<p>Any symbolic link will be fully resolved in the directory of the
importing project file before the imported project file is examined.

<p>Any source file in the imported project can be used by the sources of the
importing project, transitively. 
Thus if <cite>A</cite> imports <cite>B</cite>, which imports <cite>C</cite>, the sources of
<cite>A</cite> may depend on the sources of <cite>C</cite>, even if <cite>A</cite> does not
import <cite>C</cite> explicitly. However, this is not recommended, because if
and when <cite>B</cite> ceases to import <cite>C</cite>, some sources in <cite>A</cite> will
no longer compile. `gprbuild' has a switch `&ndash;no-indirect-imports'
that will report such indirect dependencies.

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> One very important aspect of a project hierarchy is that
`a given source can only belong to one project' (otherwise the project manager
would not know which settings apply to it and when to recompile it). It means
that different project files do not usually share source directories or
when they do, they need to specify precisely which project owns which sources
using attribute <cite>Source_Files</cite> or equivalent. By contrast, 2 projects
can each own a source with the same base file name as long as they live in
different directories. The latter is not true for Ada Sources because of the
correlation between source files and Ada units.
