<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 Output and Error Message Control</h4>

<p><a name="index-stderr-358"></a>
The standard default format for error messages is called 'brief format'. 
Brief format messages are written to <code>stderr</code> (the standard error
file) and have the following form:

<pre class="example">    e.adb:3:04: Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
    e.adb:4:20: ";" should be "is"
</pre>
<p>The first integer after the file name is the line number in the file,
and the second integer is the column number within the line. 
<cite>GPS</cite> can parse the error messages
and point to the referenced character. 
The following switches provide control over the error message
format:

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatv-_0028gcc_0029-359"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatv</code><dd>
The <cite>v</cite> stands for verbose. 
The effect of this setting is to write long-format error
messages to <code>stdout</code> (the standard output file. 
The same program compiled with the
`-gnatv' switch would generate:

     <pre class="example">         3. funcion X (Q : Integer)
            |
         &gt;&gt;&gt; Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
         4. return Integer;
                          |
         &gt;&gt;&gt; ";" should be "is"
</pre>
     <p>The vertical bar indicates the location of the error, and the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
prefix can be used to search for error messages. When this switch is
used the only source lines output are those with errors. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatl-_0028gcc_0029-360"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatl</code><dd>
The <cite>l</cite> stands for list. 
This switch causes a full listing of
the file to be generated. In the case where a body is
compiled, the corresponding spec is also listed, along
with any subunits. Typical output from compiling a package
body <code>p.adb</code> might look like:

     <pre class="example">         Compiling: p.adb
         
              1. package body p is
              2.    procedure a;
              3.    procedure a is separate;
              4. begin
              5.    null
                        |
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; missing ";"
         
              6. end;
         
         Compiling: p.ads
         
              1. package p is
              2.    pragma Elaborate_Body
                                         |
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; missing ";"
         
              3. end p;
         
         Compiling: p-a.adb
         
              1. separate p
                         |
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; missing "("
         
              2. procedure a is
              3. begin
              4.    null
                        |
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; missing ";"
         
              5. end;
</pre>
     <p>When you specify the `-gnatv' or `-gnatl' switches and
standard output is redirected, a brief summary is written to
<code>stderr</code> (standard error) giving the number of error messages and
warning messages generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatl_003dfname-_0028gcc_0029-361"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatl=`fname'</code><dd>
This has the same effect as `-gnatl' except that the output is
written to a file instead of to standard output. If the given name
<code>fname</code> does not start with a period, then it is the full name
of the file to be written. If <code>fname</code> is an extension, it is
appended to the name of the file being compiled. For example, if
file <code>xyz.adb</code> is compiled with `-gnatl=.lst',
then the output is written to file xyz.adb.lst. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatU-_0028gcc_0029-362"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatU</code><dd>
This switch forces all error messages to be preceded by the unique
string 'error:'. This means that error messages take a few more
characters in space, but allows easy searching for and identification
of error messages. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatb-_0028gcc_0029-363"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatb</code><dd>
The <cite>b</cite> stands for brief. 
This switch causes GNAT to generate the
brief format error messages to <code>stderr</code> (the standard error
file) as well as the verbose
format message or full listing (which as usual is written to
<code>stdout</code> (the standard output file). 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatm-_0028gcc_0029-364"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatm=`n'</code><dd>
The <cite>m</cite> stands for maximum. 
<cite>n</cite> is a decimal integer in the
range of 1 to 999999 and limits the number of error or warning
messages to be generated. For example, using
`-gnatm2' might yield

     <pre class="example">         e.adb:3:04: Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
         e.adb:5:35: missing ".."
         fatal error: maximum number of errors detected
         compilation abandoned
</pre>
     <p>The default setting if
no switch is given is 9999. If the number of warnings reaches this
limit, then a message is output and further warnings are suppressed,
but the compilation is continued. If the number of error messages
reaches this limit, then a message is output and the compilation
is abandoned. A value of zero means that no limit applies.

     <p>Note that the equal sign is optional, so the switches
`-gnatm2' and `-gnatm=2' are equivalent. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatf-_0028gcc_0029-365"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatf</code><dd>
<a name="index-Error-messages-366"></a><a name="index-suppressing-367"></a>
The <cite>f</cite> stands for full. 
Normally, the compiler suppresses error messages that are likely to be
redundant. This switch causes all error
messages to be generated. In particular, in the case of
references to undefined variables. If a given variable is referenced
several times, the normal format of messages is

     <pre class="example">         e.adb:7:07: "V" is undefined (more references follow)
</pre>
     <p>where the parenthetical comment warns that there are additional
references to the variable <cite>V</cite>. Compiling the same program with the
`-gnatf' switch yields

     <pre class="example">         e.adb:7:07: "V" is undefined
         e.adb:8:07: "V" is undefined
         e.adb:8:12: "V" is undefined
         e.adb:8:16: "V" is undefined
         e.adb:9:07: "V" is undefined
         e.adb:9:12: "V" is undefined
</pre>
     <p>The `-gnatf' switch also generates additional information for
some error messages.  Some examples are:

          <ul>
<li>Details on possibly non-portable unchecked conversion

          <li>List possible interpretations for ambiguous calls

          <li>Additional details on incorrect parameters
</ul>
     </dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatjnn-_0028gcc_0029-368"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatjnn</code><dd>
In normal operation mode (or if `-gnatj0' is used), then error messages
with continuation lines are treated as though the continuation lines were
separate messages (and so a warning with two continuation lines counts as
three warnings, and is listed as three separate messages).

     <p>If the `-gnatjnn' switch is used with a positive value for nn, then
messages are output in a different manner. A message and all its continuation
lines are treated as a unit, and count as only one warning or message in the
statistics totals. Furthermore, the message is reformatted so that no line
is longer than nn characters. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatq-_0028gcc_0029-369"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatq</code><dd>
The <cite>q</cite> stands for quit (really 'don't quit'). 
In normal operation mode, the compiler first parses the program and
determines if there are any syntax errors. If there are, appropriate
error messages are generated and compilation is immediately terminated. 
This switch tells
GNAT to continue with semantic analysis even if syntax errors have been
found. This may enable the detection of more errors in a single run. On
the other hand, the semantic analyzer is more likely to encounter some
internal fatal error when given a syntactically invalid tree. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatQ-_0028gcc_0029-370"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatQ</code><dd>
In normal operation mode, the <code>ALI</code> file is not generated if any
illegalities are detected in the program. The use of `-gnatQ' forces
generation of the <code>ALI</code> file. This file is marked as being in
error, so it cannot be used for binding purposes, but it does contain
reasonably complete cross-reference information, and thus may be useful
for use by tools (e.g., semantic browsing tools or integrated development
environments) that are driven from the <code>ALI</code> file. This switch
implies `-gnatq', since the semantic phase must be run to get a
meaningful ALI file.

     <p>In addition, if `-gnatt' is also specified, then the tree file is
generated even if there are illegalities. It may be useful in this case
to also specify `-gnatq' to ensure that full semantic processing
occurs. The resulting tree file can be processed by ASIS, for the purpose
of providing partial information about illegal units, but if the error
causes the tree to be badly malformed, then ASIS may crash during the
analysis.

     <p>When `-gnatQ' is used and the generated <code>ALI</code> file is marked as
being in error, `gnatmake' will attempt to recompile the source when it
finds such an <code>ALI</code> file, including with switch `-gnatc'.

     <p>Note that `-gnatQ' has no effect if `-gnats' is specified,
since ALI files are never generated if `-gnats' is set. 
</dl>
