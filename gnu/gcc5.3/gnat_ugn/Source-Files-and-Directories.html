<h4 class="subsection">5.2.1 Source Files and Directories</h4>

<p>When you create a new project, the first thing to describe is how to find the
corresponding source files. These are the only settings that are needed by all
the tools that will use this project (builder, compiler, binder and linker for
the compilation, IDEs to edit the source files,...).

<p><a name="index-Source-directories-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-777"></a>
The first step is to declare the source directories, which are the directories
to be searched to find source files. In the case of the example,
the <code>common</code> directory is the only source directory.

<p><a name="index-Source_005fDirs-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-778"></a>
There are several ways of defining source directories:

     <ul>
<li>When the attribute `Source_Dirs' is not used, a project contains a
single source directory which is the one where the project file itself
resides. In our example, if <code>build.gpr</code> is placed in the <code>common</code>
directory, the project has the needed implicit source directory.

     <li>The attribute `Source_Dirs' can be set to a list of path names, one
for each of the source directories. Such paths can either be absolute
names (for instance <code>"/usr/local/common/"</code> on UNIX), or relative to the
directory in which the project file resides (for instance "." if
<code>build.gpr</code> is inside <code>common/</code>, or "common" if it is one level up). 
Each of the source directories must exist and be readable.

     <p><a name="index-portability-of-path-names-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-779"></a>
The syntax for directories is platform specific. For portability, however,
the project manager will always properly translate UNIX-like path names to
the native format of the specific platform. For instance, when the same
project file is to be used both on Unix and Windows, "/" should be used as
the directory separator rather than "\".

     <li>The attribute `Source_Dirs' can automatically include subdirectories
using a special syntax inspired by some UNIX shells. If any of the paths in
the list ends with "<code>**</code>", then that path and all its subdirectories
(recursively) are included in the list of source directories. For instance,
<code>**</code> and <code>./**</code> represent the complete directory tree rooted at
the directory in which the project file resides.

     <p><a name="index-Source-directories-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-780"></a>
<a name="index-Excluded_005fSource_005fDirs-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-781"></a>
When using that construct, it can sometimes be convenient to also use the
attribute `Excluded_Source_Dirs', which is also a list of paths. Each entry
specifies a directory whose immediate content, not including subdirs, is to
be excluded. It is also possible to exclude a complete directory subtree
using the "**" notation.

     <p><a name="index-Ignore_005fSource_005fSub_005fDirs-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-782"></a>
It is often desirable to remove, from the source directories, directory
subtrees rooted at some subdirectories. An example is the subdirectories
created by a Version Control System such as Subversion that creates directory
subtrees rooted at subdirectories ".svn". To do that, attribute
`Ignore_Source_Sub_Dirs' can be used. It specifies the list of simple
file names for the roots of these undesirable directory subtrees.

     <!-- code-block: ada-project -->
     <!-- for Source_Dirs use ("./**"); -->
     <!-- for Ignore_Source_Sub_Dirs use (".svn"); -->
</ul>

<p>When applied to the simple example, and because we generally prefer to have
the project file at the toplevel directory rather than mixed with the sources,
we will create the following file

<!-- code-block: ada-project -->
<!-- build.gpr -->
<!-- project Build is -->
<!-- for Source_Dirs use ("common");  -  <<<< -->
<!-- end Build; -->
<p>Once source directories have been specified, one may need to indicate
source files of interest. By default, all source files present in the source
directories are considered by the project manager. When this is not desired,
it is possible to specify the list of sources to consider explicitly. 
In such a case, only source file base names are indicated and not
their absolute or relative path names. The project manager is in charge of
locating the specified source files in the specified source directories.

     <ul>
<li>By default, the project manager searches for all source files of all
specified languages in all the source directories.

     <p>Since the project manager was initially developed for Ada environments, the
default language is usually Ada and the above project file is complete: it
defines without ambiguity the sources composing the project: that is to say,
all the sources in subdirectory "common" for the default language (Ada) using
the default naming convention.

     <p><a name="index-Languages-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-783"></a>
However, when compiling a multi-language application, or a pure C
application, the project manager must be told which languages are of
interest, which is done by setting the `Languages' attribute to a list of
strings, each of which is the name of a language. Tools like
`gnatmake' only know about Ada, while other tools like
`gprbuild' know about many more languages such as C, C++, Fortran,
assembly and others can be added dynamically.

     <p><a name="index-Naming-scheme-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-784"></a>
Even when using only Ada, the default naming might not be suitable. Indeed,
how does the project manager recognizes an "Ada file" from any other
file? Project files can describe the naming scheme used for source files,
and override the default (see <a href="14b.html#g_t14b">Naming Schemes</a>). The default is the
standard GNAT extension (<code>.adb</code> for bodies and <code>.ads</code> for
specs), which is what is used in our example, explaining why no naming scheme
is explicitly specified. 
See <a href="14b.html#g_t14b">Naming Schemes</a>.

     <p><a name="index-Source_005fFiles-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-785"></a>
<li><cite>Source_Files</cite>. 
In some cases, source directories might contain files that should not be
included in a project. One can specify the explicit list of file names to
be considered through the `Source_Files' attribute. 
When this attribute is defined, instead of looking at every file in the
source directories, the project manager takes only those names into
consideration  reports  errors if they cannot be found in the source
directories or does not correspond to the naming scheme.

     <li>For various reasons, it is sometimes useful to have a project with no
sources (most of the time because the attributes defined in the project
file will be reused in other projects, as explained in
<a href="14e.html#g_t14e">Organizing Projects into Subsystems</a>. To do this, the attribute
`Source_Files' is set to the empty list, i.e. <cite>()</cite>. Alternatively,
`Source_Dirs' can be set to the empty list, with the same
result.

     <p><a name="index-Source_005fList_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-786"></a>
<li><cite>Source_List_File</cite>. 
If there is a great number of files, it might be more convenient to use
the attribute `Source_List_File', which specifies the full path of a file. 
This file must contain a list of source file names (one per line, no
directory information) that are searched as if they had been defined
through `Source_Files'. Such a file can easily be created through
external tools.

     <p>A warning is issued if both attributes <cite>Source_Files</cite> and
<cite>Source_List_File</cite> are given explicit values. In this case, the
attribute <cite>Source_Files</cite> prevails.

     <p><a name="index-Excluded_005fSource_005fFiles-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-787"></a>
<a name="index-Locally_005fRemoved_005fFiles-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-788"></a>
<a name="index-Excluded_005fSource_005fList_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-789"></a>
<li><cite>Excluded_Source_Files</cite>. 
Specifying an explicit list of files is not always convenient.It might be
more convenient to use the default search rules with specific exceptions. 
This can be done thanks to the attribute `Excluded_Source_Files'
(or its synonym `Locally_Removed_Files'). 
Its value is the list of file names that should not be taken into account. 
This attribute is often used when extending a project,
see <a href="14f.html#g_t14f">Project Extension</a>. A similar attribute
`Excluded_Source_List_File' plays the same
role but takes the name of file containing file names similarly to
<cite>Source_List_File</cite>. 
</ul>

<p>In most simple cases, such as the above example, the default source file search
behavior provides the expected result, and we do not need to add anything after
setting <cite>Source_Dirs</cite>. The project manager automatically finds
<code>pack.ads</code>, <code>pack.adb</code>, and <code>proc.adb</code> as source files of the
project.

<p>Note that by default a warning is issued when a project has no sources attached
to it and this is not explicitly indicated in the project file.
