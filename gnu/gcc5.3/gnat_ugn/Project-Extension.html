<h3 class="section">5.6 Project Extension</h3>

<p>During development of a large system, it is sometimes necessary to use
modified versions of some of the source files, without changing the original
sources. This can be achieved through the `project extension' facility.

<p>Suppose for instance that our example <cite>Build</cite> project is built every night
for the whole team, in some shared directory. A developer usually needs to work
on a small part of the system, and might not want to have a copy of all the
sources and all the object files (mostly because that would require too much
disk space, time to recompile everything). He prefers to be able to override
some of the source files in his directory, while taking advantage of all the
object files generated at night.

<p>Another example can be taken from large software systems, where it is common to have
multiple implementations of a common interface; in Ada terms, multiple
versions of a package body for the same spec.  For example, one implementation
might be safe for use in tasking programs, while another might be used only
in sequential applications.  This can be modeled in GNAT using the concept
of `project extension'.  If one project (the 'child') `extends'
another project (the 'parent') then by default all source files of the
parent project are inherited by the child, but the child project can
override any of the parent's source files with new versions, and can also
add new files or remove unnecessary ones. 
This facility is the project analog of a type extension in
object-oriented programming.  Project hierarchies are permitted (an extending
project may itself be extended), and a project that
extends a project can also import other projects.

<p>A third example is that of using project extensions to provide different
versions of the same system. For instance, assume that a <cite>Common</cite>
project is used by two development branches. One of the branches has now
been frozen, and no further change can be done to it or to <cite>Common</cite>. 
However, the other development branch still needs evolution of <cite>Common</cite>. 
Project extensions provide a flexible solution to create a new version
of a subsystem while sharing and reusing as much as possible from the original
one.

<p>A project extension implicitly inherits all the sources and objects from the
project it extends. It is possible to create a new version of some of the
sources in one of the additional source directories of the extending
project. Those new versions hide the original versions. Adding new sources or
removing existing ones is also possible. Here is an example on how to extend
the project <cite>Build</cite> from previous examples:

<pre class="example">    project Work extends "../bld/build.gpr" is
    end Work;
</pre>
<p>The project after `extends' is the one being extended. As usual, it can be
specified using an absolute path, or a path relative to any of the directories
in the project path (see <a href="16c.html#g_t16c">Project Dependencies</a>). This project does not
specify source or object directories, so the default values for these
attributes will be used that is to say the current directory (where project
<cite>Work</cite> is placed). We can compile that project with

<pre class="example">    gprbuild -Pwork
</pre>
<p>If no sources have been placed in the current directory, this command
won't do anything, since this project does not change the
sources it inherited from <cite>Build</cite>, therefore all the object files
in <cite>Build</cite> and its dependencies are still valid and are reused
automatically.

<p>Suppose we now want to supply an alternate version of <code>pack.adb</code> but use
the existing versions of <code>pack.ads</code> and <code>proc.adb</code>.  We can create
the new file in Work's current directory (likely by copying the one from the
<cite>Build</cite> project and making changes to it. If new packages are needed at
the same time, we simply create new files in the source directory of the
extending project.

<p>When we recompile, `gprbuild' will now automatically recompile
this file (thus creating <code>pack.o</code> in the current directory) and
any file that depends on it (thus creating <code>proc.o</code>). Finally, the
executable is also linked locally.

<p>Note that we could have obtained the desired behavior using project import
rather than project inheritance. A <cite>base</cite> project would contain the
sources for <code>pack.ads</code> and <code>proc.adb</code>, and <cite>Work</cite> would
import <cite>base</cite> and add <code>pack.adb</code>. In this scenario,  <cite>base</cite>
cannot contain the original version of <code>pack.adb</code> otherwise there would be
2 versions of the same unit in the closure of the project and this is not
allowed. Generally speaking, it is not recommended to put the spec and the
body of a unit in different projects since this affects their autonomy and
reusability.

<p>In a project file that extends another project, it is possible to
indicate that an inherited source is `not part' of the sources of the
extending project. This is necessary sometimes when a package spec has
been overridden and no longer requires a body: in this case, it is
necessary to indicate that the inherited body is not part of the sources
of the project, otherwise there will be a compilation error
when compiling the spec.

<p><a name="index-Excluded_005fSource_005fFiles-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-849"></a>
<a name="index-Excluded_005fSource_005fList_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-850"></a>
For that purpose, the attribute `Excluded_Source_Files' is used. 
Its value is a list of file names. 
It is also possible to use attribute <cite>Excluded_Source_List_File</cite>. 
Its value is the path of a text file containing one file name per
line.

<pre class="example">    project Work extends "../bld/build.gpr" is
       for Source_Files use ("pack.ads");
       --  New spec of Pkg does not need a completion
       for Excluded_Source_Files use ("pack.adb");
    end Work;
</pre>
<p>All packages that are not declared in the extending project are inherited from
the project being extended, with their attributes, with the exception of
<cite>Linker'Linker_Options</cite> which is never inherited. In particular, an
extending project retains all the switches specified in the project being
extended.

<p>At the project level, if they are not declared in the extending project, some
attributes are inherited from the project being extended. They are:
<cite>Languages</cite>, <cite>Main</cite> (for a root non library project) and
<cite>Library_Name</cite> (for a project extending a library project).
