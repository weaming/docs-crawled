<h4 class="subsection">4.3.3 Warning Message Control</h4>

<p><a name="index-Warning-messages-371"></a>
In addition to error messages, which correspond to illegalities as defined
in the Ada Reference Manual, the compiler detects two kinds of warning
situations.

<p>First, the compiler considers some constructs suspicious and generates a
warning message to alert you to a possible error. Second, if the
compiler detects a situation that is sure to raise an exception at
run time, it generates a warning message. The following shows an example
of warning messages:

<pre class="example">    e.adb:4:24: warning: creation of object may raise Storage_Error
    e.adb:10:17: warning: static value out of range
    e.adb:10:17: warning: "Constraint_Error" will be raised at run time
</pre>
<p>GNAT considers a large number of situations as appropriate
for the generation of warning messages. As always, warnings are not
definite indications of errors. For example, if you do an out-of-range
assignment with the deliberate intention of raising a
<cite>Constraint_Error</cite> exception, then the warning that may be
issued does not indicate an error. Some of the situations for which GNAT
issues warnings (at least some of the time) are given in the following
list. This list is not complete, and new warnings are often added to
subsequent versions of GNAT. The list is intended to give a general idea
of the kinds of warnings that are generated.

     <ul>
<li>Possible infinitely recursive calls

     <li>Out-of-range values being assigned

     <li>Possible order of elaboration problems

     <li>Size not a multiple of alignment for a record type

     <li>Assertions (pragma Assert) that are sure to fail

     <li>Unreachable code

     <li>Address clauses with possibly unaligned values, or where an attempt is
made to overlay a smaller variable with a larger one.

     <li>Fixed-point type declarations with a null range

     <li>Direct_IO or Sequential_IO instantiated with a type that has access values

     <li>Variables that are never assigned a value

     <li>Variables that are referenced before being initialized

     <li>Task entries with no corresponding <cite>accept</cite> statement

     <li>Duplicate accepts for the same task entry in a <cite>select</cite>

     <li>Objects that take too much storage

     <li>Unchecked conversion between types of differing sizes

     <li>Missing <cite>return</cite> statement along some execution path in a function

     <li>Incorrect (unrecognized) pragmas

     <li>Incorrect external names

     <li>Allocation from empty storage pool

     <li>Potentially blocking operation in protected type

     <li>Suspicious parenthesization of expressions

     <li>Mismatching bounds in an aggregate

     <li>Attempt to return local value by reference

     <li>Premature instantiation of a generic body

     <li>Attempt to pack aliased components

     <li>Out of bounds array subscripts

     <li>Wrong length on string assignment

     <li>Violations of style rules if style checking is enabled

     <li>Unused `with' clauses

     <li><cite>Bit_Order</cite> usage that does not have any effect

     <li><cite>Standard.Duration</cite> used to resolve universal fixed expression

     <li>Dereference of possibly null value

     <li>Declaration that is likely to cause storage error

     <li>Internal GNAT unit `with'ed by application unit

     <li>Values known to be out of range at compile time

     <li>Unreferenced or unmodified variables. Note that a special
exemption applies to variables which contain any of the substrings
<cite>DISCARD, DUMMY, IGNORE, JUNK, UNUSED</cite>, in any casing. Such variables
are considered likely to be intentionally used in a situation where
otherwise a warning would be given, so warnings of this kind are
always suppressed for such variables.

     <li>Address overlays that could clobber memory

     <li>Unexpected initialization when address clause present

     <li>Bad alignment for address clause

     <li>Useless type conversions

     <li>Redundant assignment statements and other redundant constructs

     <li>Useless exception handlers

     <li>Accidental hiding of name by child unit

     <li>Access before elaboration detected at compile time

     <li>A range in a <cite>for</cite> loop that is known to be null or might be null
</ul>

<p>The following section lists compiler switches that are available
to control the handling of warning messages. It is also possible
to exercise much finer control over what warnings are issued and
suppressed using the GNAT pragma Warnings (see the description
of the pragma in the <cite>GNAT_Reference_manual</cite>).

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwa-_0028gcc_0029-372"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwa</code><dd>
`Activate most optional warnings.'

     <p>This switch activates most optional warning messages.  See the remaining list
in this section for details on optional warning messages that can be
individually controlled.  The warnings that are not turned on by this
switch are:

          <ul>
<li><code>-gnatwd</code> (implicit dereferencing)

          <li><code>-gnatw.d</code> (tag warnings with -gnatw switch)

          <li><code>-gnatwh</code> (hiding)

          <li><code>-gnatw.h</code> (holes in record layouts)

          <li><code>-gnatw.k</code> (redefinition of names in standard)

          <li><code>-gnatwl</code> (elaboration warnings)

          <li><code>-gnatw.l</code> (inherited aspects)

          <li><code>-gnatw.n</code> (atomic synchronization)

          <li><code>-gnatwo</code> (address clause overlay)

          <li><code>-gnatw.o</code> (values set by out parameters ignored)

          <li><code>-gnatw.s</code> (overridden size clause)

          <li><code>-gnatwt</code> (tracking of deleted conditional code)

          <li><code>-gnatw.u</code> (unordered enumeration)

          <li><code>-gnatw.w</code> (use of Warnings Off)

          <li><code>-gnatw.y</code> (reasons for package needing body)
</ul>

     <p>All other optional warnings are turned on. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwA-_0028gcc_0029-373"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwA</code><dd>
`Suppress all optional errors.'

     <p>This switch suppresses all optional warning messages, see remaining list
in this section for details on optional warning messages that can be
individually controlled. Note that unlike switch `-gnatws', the
use of switch `-gnatwA' does not suppress warnings that are
normally given unconditionally and cannot be individually controlled
(for example, the warning about a missing exit path in a function). 
Also, again unlike switch `-gnatws', warnings suppressed by
the use of switch `-gnatwA' can be individually turned back
on. For example the use of switch `-gnatwA' followed by
switch `-gnatwd' will suppress all optional warnings except
the warnings for implicit dereferencing. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002ea-_0028gcc_0029-374"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.a</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on failing assertions.'

     <p><a name="index-Assert-failures-375"></a>
This switch activates warnings for assertions where the compiler can tell at
compile time that the assertion will fail. Note that this warning is given
even if assertions are disabled. The default is that such warnings are
generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002eA-_0028gcc_0029-376"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.A</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on failing assertions.'

     <p><a name="index-Assert-failures-377"></a>
This switch suppresses warnings for assertions where the compiler can tell at
compile time that the assertion will fail. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwb-_0028gcc_0029-378"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwb</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on bad fixed values.'

     <p><a name="index-Bad-fixed-values-379"></a>
<a name="index-Fixed_002dpoint-Small-value-380"></a>
<a name="index-Small-value-381"></a>
This switch activates warnings for static fixed-point expressions whose
value is not an exact multiple of Small. Such values are implementation
dependent, since an implementation is free to choose either of the multiples
that surround the value. GNAT always chooses the closer one, but this is not
required behavior, and it is better to specify a value that is an exact
multiple, ensuring predictable execution. The default is that such warnings
are not generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwB-_0028gcc_0029-382"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwB</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on bad fixed values.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for static fixed-point expressions whose
value is not an exact multiple of Small. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002eb-_0028gcc_0029-383"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.b</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on biased representation.'

     <p><a name="index-Biased-representation-384"></a>
This switch activates warnings when a size clause, value size clause, component
clause, or component size clause forces the use of biased representation for an
integer type (e.g. representing a range of 10..11 in a single bit by using 0/1
to represent 10/11). The default is that such warnings are generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwB-_0028gcc_0029-385"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.B</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on biased representation.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for representation clauses that force the use
of biased representation. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwc-_0028gcc_0029-386"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwc</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on conditionals.'

     <p><a name="index-Conditionals-387"></a><a name="index-constant-388"></a>
This switch activates warnings for conditional expressions used in
tests that are known to be True or False at compile time. The default
is that such warnings are not generated. 
Note that this warning does
not get issued for the use of boolean variables or constants whose
values are known at compile time, since this is a standard technique
for conditional compilation in Ada, and this would generate too many
false positive warnings.

     <p>This warning option also activates a special test for comparisons using
the operators '&gt;=' and' &lt;='. 
If the compiler can tell that only the equality condition is possible,
then it will warn that the '&gt;' or '&lt;' part of the test
is useless and that the operator could be replaced by '='. 
An example would be comparing a <cite>Natural</cite> variable &lt;= 0.

     <p>This warning option also generates warnings if
one or both tests is optimized away in a membership test for integer
values if the result can be determined at compile time. Range tests on
enumeration types are not included, since it is common for such tests
to include an end point.

     <p>This warning can also be turned on using `-gnatwa'. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwC-_0028gcc_0029-389"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwC</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on conditionals.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for conditional expressions used in
tests that are known to be True or False at compile time. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002ec-_0028gcc_0029-390"></a>

<dt><code>-gnatw.c</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on missing component clauses.'

     <p><a name="index-Component-clause-391"></a><a name="index-missing-392"></a>
This switch activates warnings for record components where a record
representation clause is present and has component clauses for the
majority, but not all, of the components. A warning is given for each
component for which no component clause is present. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwC-_0028gcc_0029-393"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.C</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on missing component clauses.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for record components that are
missing a component clause in the situation described above. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwd-_0028gcc_0029-394"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwd</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on implicit dereferencing.'

     <p>If this switch is set, then the use of a prefix of an access type
in an indexed component, slice, or selected component without an
explicit <cite>.all</cite> will generate a warning. With this warning
enabled, access checks occur only at points where an explicit
<cite>.all</cite> appears in the source code (assuming no warnings are
generated as a result of this switch). The default is that such
warnings are not generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwD-_0028gcc_0029-395"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwD</code><dd>

     <p><a name="index-Implicit-dereferencing-396"></a>
<a name="index-Dereferencing-397"></a><a name="index-implicit-398"></a>
This switch suppresses warnings for implicit dereferences in
indexed components, slices, and selected components. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002ed-_0028gcc_0029-399"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.d</code><dd>
`Activate tagging of warning and info messages.'

     <p>If this switch is set, then warning messages are tagged, with one of the
following strings:

     <blockquote>

          <ul>
<li>`[-gnatw?]' 
Used to tag warnings controlled by the switch `-gnatwx' where x
is a letter a-z.

          <li>`[-gnatw.?]' 
Used to tag warnings controlled by the switch `-gnatw.x' where x
is a letter a-z.

          <li>`[-gnatel]'
Used to tag elaboration information (info) messages generated when the
static model of elaboration is used and the `-gnatel' switch is set.

          <li>`[restriction warning]'
Used to tag warning messages for restriction violations, activated by use
of the pragma `Restriction_Warnings'.

          <li>`[warning-as-error]'
Used to tag warning messages that have been converted to error messages by
use of the pragma Warning_As_Error. Note that such warnings are prefixed by
the string "error: " rather than "warning: ".

          <li>`[enabled by default]'
Used to tag all other warnings that are always given by default, unless
warnings are completely suppressed using pragma `Warnings(Off)' or
the switch `-gnatws'. 
</ul>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.D</code><dd>
`Deactivate tagging of warning and info messages messages.'

     <p>If this switch is set, then warning messages return to the default
mode in which warnings and info messages are not tagged as described above for
<cite>-gnatw.d</cite>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwe</code><dd>
`Treat warnings and style checks as errors.'

     <p>This switch causes warning messages and style check messages to be
treated as errors. 
The warning string still appears, but the warning messages are counted
as errors, and prevent the generation of an object file. Note that this
is the only -gnatw switch that affects the handling of style check messages. 
Note also that this switch has no effect on info (information) messages, which
are not treated as errors if this switch is present.

`Activate every optional warning'

     <p><a name="index-Warnings-405"></a><a name="index-activate-every-optional-warning-406"></a>
This switch activates all optional warnings, including those which
are not activated by <cite>-gnatwa</cite>. The use of this switch is not
recommended for normal use. If you turn this switch on, it is almost
certain that you will get large numbers of useless warnings. The
warnings that are excluded from <cite>-gnatwa</cite> are typically highly
specialized warnings that are suitable for use only in code that has
been specifically designed according to specialized coding rules. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwf-_0028gcc_0029-407"></a>

<dt><code>-gnatwf</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on unreferenced formals.'

     <p><a name="index-Formals-408"></a><a name="index-unreferenced-409"></a>
This switch causes a warning to be generated if a formal parameter
is not referenced in the body of the subprogram. This warning can
also be turned on using `-gnatwu'. The
default is that these warnings are not generated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwF-_0028gcc_0029-410"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwF</code><dd>
`Suppress warnings on unreferenced formals.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for unreferenced formal
parameters. Note that the
combination `-gnatwu' followed by `-gnatwF' has the
effect of warning on unreferenced entities other than subprogram
formals. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwg-_0028gcc_0029-411"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwg</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on unrecognized pragmas.'

     <p><a name="index-Pragmas-412"></a><a name="index-unrecognized-413"></a>
This switch causes a warning to be generated if an unrecognized
pragma is encountered. Apart from issuing this warning, the
pragma is ignored and has no effect. The default
is that such warnings are issued (satisfying the Ada Reference
Manual requirement that such warnings appear). 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwG-_0028gcc_0029-414"></a>

     <dl>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatw.g</code><dd>
`Warnings used for GNAT sources'

     <p>This switch sets the warning categories that are used by the standard
GNAT style. Currently this is equivalent to
`-gnatwAao.sI.C.V.X'
but more warnings may be added in the future without advanced notice. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwh-_0028gcc_0029-416"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-gnatwh</code><dd>
`Activate warnings on hiding.'

     <p><a name="index-Hiding-of-Declarations-417"></a>
This switch activates warnings on hiding declarations. 
A declaration is considered hiding
if it is for a non-overloadable entity, and it declares an entity with the
same name as some other entity that is directly or use-visible. The default
is that such warnings are not generated. 
</dl>

`Activate warnings on holes/gaps in records.'

     <p><a name="index-Record-Representation-_0028gaps_0029-420"></a>
This switch activates warnings on component clauses in record
representation clauses that leave holes (gaps) in the record layout. 
If this warning option is active, then record representation clauses
should specify a contiguous layout, adding unused fill fields if needed. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002eH-_0028gcc_0029-421"></a>

`Activate warnings on implementation units.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings for a `with' of an internal GNAT
implementation unit, defined as any unit from the <cite>Ada</cite>,
<cite>Interfaces</cite>, <cite>GNAT</cite>,
or <cite>System</cite>
hierarchies that is not
documented in either the Ada Reference Manual or the GNAT
Programmer's Reference Manual. Such units are intended only
for internal implementation purposes and should not be `with'ed
by user programs. The default is that such warnings are generated
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatwI-_0028gcc_0029-423"></a>

     <dl>

`Activate warnings on overlapping actuals.'

     <p>This switch enables a warning on statically detectable overlapping actuals in
a subprogram call, when one of the actuals is an in-out parameter, and the
types of the actuals are not by-copy types. This warning is off by default. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dgnatw_002eI-_0028gcc_0029-425"></a>

     <dl>

`Activate warnings on obsolescent features (Annex J).'

     <p><a name="index-Features-427"></a><a name="index-obsolescent-428"></a>
<a name="index-Obsolescent-features-429"></a>
If this warning option is activated, then warnings are generated for
calls to subprograms marked with <cite>pragma Obsolescent</cite> and
for use of features in Annex J of the Ada Reference Manual. In the
case of Annex J, not all features are flagged. In particular use
of the renamed packages (like <cite>Text_IO</cite>) and use of package
<cite>ASCII</cite> are not flagged, since these are very common and
would generate many annoying positive warnings. The default is that
such warnings are not generated.

     <p>In addition to the above cases, warnings are also generated for
GNAT features that have been provided in past versions but which
have been superseded (typically by features in the new Ada standard). 
For example, <cite>pragma Ravenscar</cite> will be flagged since its
function is replaced by <cite>pragma Profile(Ravenscar)</cite>, and
<cite>pragma Interface_Name</cite> will be flagged since its function
is replaced by <cite>pragma Import</cite>.

     <p>Note that this warning option functions differently from the
restriction <cite>No_Obsolescent_Features</cite> in two respects. 
First, the restriction applies only to annex J features. 
Second, the restriction does flag uses of package <cite>ASCII</cite>.

`Activate warnings on questionable missing parentheses.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings for cases where parentheses are not used and
the result is potential ambiguity from a readers point of view. For example
(not a &gt; b) when a and b are modular means ((not a) &gt; b) and very likely the
programmer intended (not (a &gt; b)). Similarly (-x mod 5) means (-(x mod 5)) and
quite likely ((-x) mod 5) was intended. In such situations it seems best to

<cite>Contract_Cases</cite>). A function postcondition or contract case is suspicious
when no postcondition or contract case for this function mentions the result
of the function.  A procedure postcondition or contract case is suspicious
when it only refers to the pre-state of the procedure, because in that case
it should rather be expressed as a precondition. This switch also controls
warnings on suspicious cases of expressions typically found in contracts like
quantified expressions and uses of Update attribute. The default is that such

`Activate warnings on unused entities.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings to be generated for entities that
are declared but not referenced, and for units that are `with'ed

referenced. In the case of packages, a warning is also generated if
no entities in the package are referenced. This means that if a with'ed
package is referenced but the only references are in <cite>use</cite>
clauses or <cite>renames</cite>
declarations, a warning is still generated. A warning is also generated
for a generic package that is `with'ed but never instantiated. 
In the case where a package or subprogram body is compiled, and there
is a `with' on the corresponding spec
that is only referenced in the body,
a warning is also generated, noting that the

ordered. (A `client' is defined as a unit that is other than the unit in
which the type is declared, or its body or subunits.) Please refer to

`Activate warnings on Export/Import pragmas.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings on Export/Import pragmas when
the compiler detects a possible conflict between the Ada and
foreign language calling sequences. For example, the use of
default parameters in a convention C procedure is dubious
because the C compiler cannot supply the proper default, so
a warning is issued. The default is that such warnings are
generated.

`Suppress warnings on Export/Import pragmas.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings on Export/Import pragmas. 
The sense of this is that you are telling the compiler that
you know what you are doing in writing the pragma, and it
should not complain at you.

`Activate warnings for No_Exception_Propagation mode.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings for exception usage when pragma Restrictions
(No_Exception_Propagation) is in effect. Warnings are given for implicit or
explicit exception raises which are not covered by a local handler, and for
exception handlers which do not cover a local raise. The default is that these
warnings are not given.

     <br><dt><code>-gnatw.X</code><dd>

`Activate warnings for Ada compatibility issues.'

     <p>For the most part, newer versions of Ada are upwards compatible
with older versions. For example, Ada 2005 programs will almost
always work when compiled as Ada 2012. 
However there are some exceptions (for example the fact that
<cite>some</cite> is now a reserved word in Ada 2012). This
switch activates several warnings to help in identifying
and correcting such incompatibilities. The default is that
these warnings are generated. Note that at one point Ada 2005
was called Ada 0Y, hence the choice of character.

`Activate information messages for why package spec needs body'

     <p>There are a number of cases in which a package spec needs a body. 
For example, the use of pragma Elaborate_Body, or the declaration
of a procedure specification requiring a completion. This switch
causes information messages to be output showing why a package
specification requires a body. This can be useful in the case of
a large package specification which is unexpectedly requiring a
body. The default is that such information messages are not output.

`Activate warnings on unchecked conversions.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings for unchecked conversions
where the types are known at compile time to have different

`Activate warnings for size not a multiple of alignment.'

     <p>This switch activates warnings for cases of record types with

size is not a multiple of the alignment, resulting in an object
size that is greater than the specified size. The default
is that such warnings are generated.

`Suppress warnings for size not a multiple of alignment.'

     <p>This switch suppresses warnings for cases of record types with
specified <cite>Size</cite> and <cite>Alignment</cite> attributes where the
size is not a multiple of the alignment, resulting in an object
size that is greater than the specified size.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wunused</code><dd>
The warnings controlled by the `-gnatw' switch are generated by
the front end of the compiler. The `GCC' back end can provide
additional warnings and they are controlled by the `-W' switch. 
For example, `-Wunused' activates back end
warnings for entities that are declared but not referenced. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dWuninitialized-_0028gcc_0029-520"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wuninitialized</code><dd>
Similarly, `-Wuninitialized' activates
the back end warning for uninitialized variables. This switch must be
used in conjunction with an optimization level greater than zero.

Warn if the stack usage of a subprogram might be larger than <cite>len</cite> bytes.

</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dWall-_0028gcc_0029-522"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wall</code><dd>
This switch enables most warnings from the `GCC' back end. 
The code generator detects a number of warning situations that are missed
by the `GNAT' front end, and this switch can be used to activate them. 
The use of this switch also sets the default front end warning mode to
`-gnatwa', that is, most front end warnings activated as well. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dw-_0028gcc_0029-523"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-w</code><dd>
Conversely, this switch suppresses warnings from the `GCC' back end. 
The use of this switch also sets the default front end warning mode to
`-gnatws', that is, front end warnings suppressed as well. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dWerror-_0028gcc_0029-524"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Werror</code><dd>
This switch causes warnings from the `GCC' back end to be treated as
errors.  The warning string still appears, but the warning messages are
counted as errors, and prevent the generation of an object file. 
</dl>

<p>A string of warning parameters can be used in the same parameter. For example:

<pre class="example">    -gnatwaGe
</pre>
<p>will turn on all optional warnings except for unrecognized pragma warnings,
and also specify that warnings should be treated as errors.

<p>When no switch `-gnatw' is used, this is equivalent to:
