The strong typing capabilities of Ada allow an optimizer to generate
efficient code in situations where other languages would be forced to
make worst case assumptions preventing such optimizations. Consider
the following example:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    procedure R is
       type Int1 is new Integer;
       type Int2 is new Integer;
       type Int1A is access Int1;
       type Int2A is access Int2;
       Int1V : Int1A;
       Int2V : Int2A;
       ...
    
    begin
       ...
       for J in Data'Range loop
          if Data (J) = Int1V.all then
             Int2V.all := Int2V.all + 1;
          end if;
       end loop;
       ...
    end R;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, since the variable <cite>Int1V</cite> can only access objects
of type <cite>Int1</cite>, and <cite>Int2V</cite> can only access objects of type
<cite>Int2</cite>, there is no possibility that the assignment to
<cite>Int2V.all</cite> affects the value of <cite>Int1V.all</cite>. This means that
the compiler optimizer can "know" that the value <cite>Int1V.all</cite> is constant
for all iterations of the loop and avoid the extra memory reference
required to dereference it each time through the loop.

<p>This kind of optimization, called strict aliasing analysis, is
triggered by specifying an optimization level of `-O2' or
higher or `-Os' and allows <cite>GNAT</cite> to generate more efficient code
when access values are involved.

<p>However, although this optimization is always correct in terms of
the formal semantics of the Ada Reference Manual, difficulties can
arise if features like <cite>Unchecked_Conversion</cite> are used to break
the typing system. Consider the following complete program example:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    package p1 is
       type int1 is new integer;
       type int2 is new integer;
       type a1 is access int1;
       type a2 is access int2;
    end p1;
    
    with p1; use p1;
    package p2 is
       function to_a2 (Input : a1) return a2;
    end p2;
    
    with Unchecked_Conversion;
    package body p2 is
       function to_a2 (Input : a1) return a2 is
          function to_a2u is
            new Unchecked_Conversion (a1, a2);
       begin
          return to_a2u (Input);
       end to_a2;
    end p2;
    
    with p2; use p2;
    with p1; use p1;
    with Text_IO; use Text_IO;
    procedure m is
       v1 : a1 := new int1;
       v2 : a2 := to_a2 (v1);
    begin
       v1.all := 1;
       v2.all := 0;
       put_line (int1'image (v1.all));
    end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This program prints out 0 in `-O0' or `-O1'
mode, but it prints out 1 in `-O2' mode. That's
because in strict aliasing mode, the compiler can and
does assume that the assignment to <cite>v2.all</cite> could not
affect the value of <cite>v1.all</cite>, since different types
are involved.

<p>This behavior is not a case of non-conformance with the standard, since
the Ada RM specifies that an unchecked conversion where the resulting
bit pattern is not a correct value of the target type can result in an
abnormal value and attempting to reference an abnormal value makes the
execution of a program erroneous.  That's the case here since the result
does not point to an object of type <cite>int2</cite>.  This means that the
effect is entirely unpredictable.

<p>However, although that explanation may satisfy a language
lawyer, in practice an applications programmer expects an
unchecked conversion involving pointers to create true
aliases and the behavior of printing 1 seems plain wrong. 
In this case, the strict aliasing optimization is unwelcome.

<p>Indeed the compiler recognizes this possibility, and the
unchecked conversion generates a warning:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    p2.adb:5:07: warning: possible aliasing problem with type "a2"
    p2.adb:5:07: warning: use -fno-strict-aliasing switch for references
    p2.adb:5:07: warning:  or use "pragma No_Strict_Aliasing (a2);"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately the problem is recognized when compiling the body of
package <cite>p2</cite>, but the actual "bad" code is generated while
compiling the body of <cite>m</cite> and this latter compilation does not see
the suspicious <cite>Unchecked_Conversion</cite>.

<p>As implied by the warning message, there are approaches you can use to
avoid the unwanted strict aliasing optimization in a case like this.

<p>One possibility is to simply avoid the use of `-O2', but
that is a bit drastic, since it throws away a number of useful
optimizations that do not involve strict aliasing assumptions.

<p>A less drastic approach is to compile the program using the
option `-fno-strict-aliasing'. Actually it is only the
unit containing the dereferencing of the suspicious pointer
that needs to be compiled. So in this case, if we compile
unit <cite>m</cite> with this switch, then we get the expected
value of zero printed. Analyzing which units might need
the switch can be painful, so a more reasonable approach
is to compile the entire program with options `-O2'
and `-fno-strict-aliasing'. If the performance is
satisfactory with this combination of options, then the
advantage is that the entire issue of possible "wrong"
optimization due to strict aliasing is avoided.

<p>To avoid the use of compiler switches, the configuration
pragma <cite>No_Strict_Aliasing</cite> with no parameters may be
used to specify that for all access types, the strict
aliasing optimization should be suppressed.

<p>However, these approaches are still overkill, in that they causes
all manipulations of all access values to be deoptimized. A more
refined approach is to concentrate attention on the specific
access type identified as problematic.

<p>First, if a careful analysis of uses of the pointer shows
that there are no possible problematic references, then
the warning can be suppressed by bracketing the
instantiation of <cite>Unchecked_Conversion</cite> to turn
the warning off:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    pragma Warnings (Off);
    function to_a2u is
      new Unchecked_Conversion (a1, a2);
    pragma Warnings (On);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that approach is not appropriate for this particular
example, since indeed there is a problematic reference. In this
case we can take one of two other approaches.

<p>The first possibility is to move the instantiation of unchecked
conversion to the unit in which the type is declared. In
this example, we would move the instantiation of
<cite>Unchecked_Conversion</cite> from the body of package
<cite>p2</cite> to the spec of package <cite>p1</cite>. Now the
warning disappears. That's because any use of the
access type knows there is a suspicious unchecked
conversion, and the strict aliasing optimization
is automatically suppressed for the type.

<p>If it is not practical to move the unchecked conversion to the same unit
in which the destination access type is declared (perhaps because the
source type is not visible in that unit), you may use pragma
<cite>No_Strict_Aliasing</cite> for the type. This pragma must occur in the
same declarative sequence as the declaration of the access type:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type a2 is access int2;
    pragma No_Strict_Aliasing (a2);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here again, the compiler now knows that the strict aliasing optimization
should be suppressed for any reference to type <cite>a2</cite> and the
expected behavior is obtained.

<p>Finally, note that although the compiler can generate warnings for
simple cases of unchecked conversions, there are tricker and more
indirect ways of creating type incorrect aliases which the compiler
cannot detect. Examples are the use of address overlays and unchecked
conversions involving composite types containing access types as
components. In such cases, no warnings are generated, but there can
still be aliasing problems. One safe coding practice is to forbid the
use of address clauses for type overlaying, and to allow unchecked
conversion only for primitive types. This is not really a significant
restriction since any possible desired effect can be achieved by
unchecked conversion of access values.

<p>The aliasing analysis done in strict aliasing mode can certainly
have significant benefits. We have seen cases of large scale
application code where the time is increased by up to 5% by turning
this optimization off. If you have code that includes significant
usage of unchecked conversion, you might want to just stick with
`-O1' and avoid the entire issue. If you get adequate
performance at this level of optimization level, that's probably
the safest approach. If tests show that you really need higher
levels of optimization, then you can experiment with `-O2'
and `-O2 -fno-strict-aliasing' to see how much effect this
has on size and speed of the code. If you really need to use
`-O2' with strict aliasing in effect, then you should
review any uses of unchecked conversion of access types,
particularly if you are getting the warnings described above.
