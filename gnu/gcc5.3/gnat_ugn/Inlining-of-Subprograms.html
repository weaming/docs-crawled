<h5 class="subsubsection">8.3.1.5 Inlining of Subprograms</h5>

<p>A call to a subprogram in the current unit is inlined if all the
following conditions are met:

     <ul>
<li>The optimization level is at least `-O1'.

     <li>The called subprogram is suitable for inlining: It must be small enough
and not contain something that `gcc' cannot support in inlined
subprograms.

     <p><a name="index-pragma-Inline-1004"></a>
<a name="index-Inline-1005"></a>
<li>Any one of the following applies: <cite>pragma Inline</cite> is applied to the
subprogram and the `-gnatn' switch is specified; the
subprogram is local to the unit and called once from within it; the
subprogram is small and optimization level `-O2' is specified;
optimization level `-O3' is specified. 
</ul>

<p>Calls to subprograms in `with'ed units are normally not inlined. 
To achieve actual inlining (that is, replacement of the call by the code
in the body of the subprogram), the following conditions must all be true:

     <ul>
<li>The optimization level is at least `-O1'.

     <li>The called subprogram is suitable for inlining: It must be small enough
and not contain something that `gcc' cannot support in inlined
subprograms.

     <li>The call appears in a body (not in a package spec).

     <li>There is a <cite>pragma Inline</cite> for the subprogram.

     <li>The `-gnatn' switch is used on the command line. 
</ul>

<p>Even if all these conditions are met, it may not be possible for
the compiler to inline the call, due to the length of the body,
or features in the body that make it impossible for the compiler
to do the inlining.

<p>Note that specifying the `-gnatn' switch causes additional
compilation dependencies. Consider the following:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    package R is
       procedure Q;
       pragma Inline (Q);
    end R;
    package body R is
       ...
    end R;
    
    with R;
    procedure Main is
    begin
       ...
       R.Q;
    end Main;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>With the default behavior (no `-gnatn' switch specified), the
compilation of the <cite>Main</cite> procedure depends only on its own source,
<code>main.adb</code>, and the spec of the package in file <code>r.ads</code>. This
means that editing the body of <cite>R</cite> does not require recompiling
<cite>Main</cite>.

<p>On the other hand, the call <cite>R.Q</cite> is not inlined under these
circumstances. If the `-gnatn' switch is present when <cite>Main</cite>
is compiled, the call will be inlined if the body of <cite>Q</cite> is small
enough, but now <cite>Main</cite> depends on the body of <cite>R</cite> in
<code>r.adb</code> as well as on the spec. This means that if this body is edited,
the main program must be recompiled. Note that this extra dependency
occurs whether or not the call is in fact inlined by `gcc'.

<p>The use of front end inlining with `-gnatN' generates similar
additional dependencies.

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dfno_002dinline-_0028gcc_0029-1006"></a>
Note: The `-fno-inline' switch overrides all other conditions and ensures that
no inlining occurs, unless requested with pragma Inline_Always for gcc
back-ends. The extra dependences resulting from `-gnatn' will still be active,
even if this switch is used to suppress the resulting inlining actions.

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dfno_002dinline_002dfunctions-_0028gcc_0029-1007"></a>
Note: The `-fno-inline-functions' switch can be used to prevent
automatic inlining of subprograms if `-O3' is used.

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dfno_002dinline_002dsmall_002dfunctions-_0028gcc_0029-1008"></a>
Note: The `-fno-inline-small-functions' switch can be used to prevent
automatic inlining of small subprograms if `-O2' is used.

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dfno_002dinline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce-_0028gcc_0029-1009"></a>
Note: The `-fno-inline-functions-called-once' switch
can be used to prevent inlining of subprograms local to the unit
and called once from within it if `-O1' is used.

<p>Note regarding the use of `-O3': `-gnatn' is made up of two
sub-switches `-gnatn1' and `-gnatn2' that can be directly
specified in lieu of it, `-gnatn' being translated into one of them
based on the optimization level. With `-O2' or below, `-gnatn'
is equivalent to `-gnatn1' which activates pragma <cite>Inline</cite> with
moderate inlining across modules. With `-O3', `-gnatn' is
equivalent to `-gnatn2' which activates pragma <cite>Inline</cite> with
full inlining across modules. If you have used pragma <cite>Inline</cite> in
appropriate cases, then it is usually much better to use `-O2'
and `-gnatn' and avoid the use of `-O3' which has the additional
effect of inlining subprograms you did not think should be inlined. We have
found that the use of `-O3' may slow down the compilation and increase
the code size by performing excessive inlining, leading to increased
instruction cache pressure from the increased code size and thus minor
performance improvements. So the bottom line here is that you should not
automatically assume that `-O3' is better than `-O2', and
indeed you should use `-O3' only if tests show that it actually
improves performance for your program.
