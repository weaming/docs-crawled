<h3 class="section">11.2 Checking the Elaboration Order</h3>

<p>In some languages that involve the same kind of elaboration problems,
e.g., Java and C++, the programmer needs to take these
ordering problems into account, and it is common to
write a program in which an incorrect elaboration order  gives
surprising results, because it references variables before they
are initialized. 
Ada is designed to be a safe language, and a programmer-beware approach is
clearly not sufficient. Consequently, the language provides three lines
of defense:

     <ul>
<li>`Standard rules'

     <p>Some standard rules restrict the possible choice of elaboration
order. In particular, if you `with' a unit, then its spec is always
elaborated before the unit doing the `with'. Similarly, a parent
spec is always elaborated before the child spec, and finally
a spec is always elaborated before its corresponding body. 
</ul>

<p><a name="index-Elaboration-checks-1141"></a>
<a name="index-Checks-1142"></a><a name="index-elaboration-1143"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`Dynamic elaboration checks'

     <p>Dynamic checks are made at run time, so that if some entity is accessed
before it is elaborated (typically  by means of a subprogram call)
then the exception (<cite>Program_Error</cite>) is raised.

     <li>`Elaboration control'

     <p>Facilities are provided for the programmer to specify the desired order
of elaboration. 
</ul>

<p>Let's look at these facilities in more detail. First, the rules for
dynamic checking. One possible rule would be simply to say that the
exception is raised if you access a variable which has not yet been
elaborated. The trouble with this approach is that it could require
expensive checks on every variable reference. Instead Ada has two
rules which are a little more restrictive, but easier to check, and
easier to state:

     <ul>
<li>`Restrictions on calls'

     <p>A subprogram can only be called at elaboration time if its body
has been elaborated. The rules for elaboration given above guarantee
that the spec of the subprogram has been elaborated before the
call, but not the body. If this rule is violated, then the
exception <cite>Program_Error</cite> is raised.

     <li>`Restrictions on instantiations'

     <p>A generic unit can only be instantiated if the body of the generic
unit has been elaborated. Again, the rules for elaboration given above
guarantee that the spec of the generic unit has been elaborated
before the instantiation, but not the body. If this rule is
violated, then the exception <cite>Program_Error</cite> is raised. 
</ul>

<p>The idea is that if the body has been elaborated, then any variables
it references must have been elaborated; by checking for the body being
elaborated we guarantee that none of its references causes any
trouble. As we noted above, this is a little too restrictive, because a
subprogram that has no non-local references in its body may in fact be safe
to call. However, it really would be unsafe to rely on this, because
it would mean that the caller was aware of details of the implementation
in the body. This goes against the basic tenets of Ada.

<p>A plausible implementation can be described as follows. 
A Boolean variable is associated with each subprogram
and each generic unit. This variable is initialized to False, and is set to
True at the point body is elaborated. Every call or instantiation checks the
variable, and raises <cite>Program_Error</cite> if the variable is False.

<p>Note that one might think that it would be good enough to have one Boolean
variable for each package, but that would not deal with cases of trying
to call a body in the same package as the call
that has not been elaborated yet. 
Of course a compiler may be able to do enough analysis to optimize away
some of the Boolean variables as unnecessary, and <cite>GNAT</cite> indeed
does such optimizations, but still the easiest conceptual model is to
think of there being one variable per subprogram.
