<h4 class="subsection">5.9.1 Project Declaration</h4>

<p>Project files have an Ada-like syntax. The minimal project file is:

<pre class="example">    project Empty is
    end Empty;
</pre>
<p>The identifier <cite>Empty</cite> is the name of the project. 
This project name must be present after the reserved
word <cite>end</cite> at the end of the project file, followed by a semi-colon.

<p>`Identifiers' (i.e., the user-defined names such as project or variable names)
have the same syntax as Ada identifiers: they must start with a letter,
and be followed by zero or more letters, digits or underscore characters;
it is also illegal to have two underscores next to each other. Identifiers
are always case-insensitive ("Name" is the same as "name").

<pre class="example">    simple_name ::= identifier
    name        ::= simple_name { . simple_name }
</pre>
<p>`Strings' are used for values of attributes or as indexes for these
attributes. They are in general case sensitive, except when noted
otherwise (in particular, strings representing file names will be case
insensitive on some systems, so that "file.adb" and "File.adb" both
represent the same file).

<p>`Reserved words' are the same as for standard Ada 95, and cannot
be used for identifiers. In particular, the following words are currently
used in project files, but others could be added later on. In bold are the
extra reserved words in project files:
<code>all</code>, <code>at</code>, <code>case</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>limited</code>,
<code>null</code>, <code>others</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>renames</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>use</code>, <code>when</code>,
<code>with</code>, `extends', `external', `project'.

<p>`Comments' in project files have the same syntax as in Ada, two consecutive
hyphens through the end of the line.

<p>A project may be an `independent project', entirely defined by a single
project file. Any source file in an independent project depends only
on the predefined library and other source files in the same project. 
But a project may also depend on other projects, either by importing them
through `with clauses', or by `extending' at most one other project. Both
types of dependency can be used in the same project.

<p>A path name denotes a project file. It can be absolute or relative. 
An absolute path name includes a sequence of directories, in the syntax of
the host operating system, that identifies uniquely the project file in the
file system. A relative path name identifies the project file, relative
to the directory that contains the current project, or relative to a
directory listed in the environment variables ADA_PROJECT_PATH and
GPR_PROJECT_PATH. Path names are case sensitive if file names in the host
operating system are case sensitive. As a special case, the directory
separator can always be "/" even on Windows systems, so that project files
can be made portable across architectures. 
The syntax of the environment variables ADA_PROJECT_PATH and
GPR_PROJECT_PATH is a list of directory names separated by colons on UNIX and
semicolons on Windows.

<p>A given project name can appear only once in a context clause.

<p>It is illegal for a project imported by a context clause to refer, directly
or indirectly, to the project in which this context clause appears (the
dependency graph cannot contain cycles), except when one of the with clauses
in the cycle is a `limited with'.

<pre class="example">    with "other_project.gpr";
    project My_Project extends "extended.gpr" is
    end My_Project;
</pre>
<p>These dependencies form a `directed graph', potentially cyclic when using
`limited with'. The subgraph reflecting the `extends' relations is a tree.

<p>A project's `immediate sources' are the source files directly defined by
that project, either implicitly by residing in the project source directories,
or explicitly through any of the source-related attributes. 
More generally, a project's `sources' are the immediate sources of the
project together with the immediate sources (unless overridden) of any project
on which it depends directly or indirectly.

<p>A `project hierarchy' can be created, where projects are children of
other projects. The name of such a child project must be <cite>Parent.Child</cite>,
where <cite>Parent</cite> is the name of the parent project. In particular, this
makes all `with' clauses of the parent project automatically visible
in the child project.

<pre class="example">    project        ::= context_clause project_declaration
    
    context_clause ::= {with_clause}
    with_clause    ::= *with* path_name { , path_name } ;
    path_name      ::= string_literal
    
    project_declaration ::= simple_project_declaration | project_extension
    simple_project_declaration ::=
      project &lt;project_&gt;name is
        {declarative_item}
      end &lt;project_&gt;simple_name;
</pre>
</body></html>
