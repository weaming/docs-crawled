<h4 class="subsection">4.2.2 Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL)</h4>

<p>With the GNAT source-based library system, the compiler must be able to
find source files for units that are needed by the unit being compiled. 
Search paths are used to guide this process.

<p>The compiler compiles one source file whose name must be given
explicitly on the command line. In other words, no searching is done
for this file. To find all other source files that are needed (the most
common being the specs of units), the compiler examines the following
directories, in the following order:

     <ul>
<li>The directory containing the source file of the main unit being compiled
(the file name on the command line).

     <li>Each directory named by an `-I' switch given on the `gcc'
command line, in the order given.

     <p><a name="index-ADA_005fPRJ_005fINCLUDE_005fFILE-241"></a>
<li>Each of the directories listed in the text file whose name is given
by the
<a name="index-ADA_005fPRJ_005fINCLUDE_005fFILE-242"></a><a name="index-environment-variable_003b-ADA_005fPRJ_005fINCLUDE_005fFILE-243"></a><code>ADA_PRJ_INCLUDE_FILE</code> environment variable. 
<a name="index-ADA_005fPRJ_005fINCLUDE_005fFILE-244"></a><a name="index-environment-variable_003b-ADA_005fPRJ_005fINCLUDE_005fFILE-245"></a><code>ADA_PRJ_INCLUDE_FILE</code> is normally set by gnatmake or by the gnat
driver when project files are used. It should not normally be set
by other means.

     <p><a name="index-ADA_005fINCLUDE_005fPATH-246"></a>
<li>Each of the directories listed in the value of the
<a name="index-ADA_005fINCLUDE_005fPATH-247"></a><a name="index-environment-variable_003b-ADA_005fINCLUDE_005fPATH-248"></a><code>ADA_INCLUDE_PATH</code> environment variable. 
Construct this value
exactly as the
<a name="index-PATH-249"></a><a name="index-environment-variable_003b-PATH-250"></a><code>PATH</code> environment variable: a list of directory
names separated by colons (semicolons when working with the NT version).

     <li>The content of the <code>ada_source_path</code> file which is part of the GNAT
installation tree and is used to store standard libraries such as the
GNAT Run Time Library (RTL) source files. 
<a href="8b.html#g_t8b">Installing a library</a>
</ul>

<p>Specifying the switch `-I-'
inhibits the use of the directory
containing the source file named in the command line. You can still
have this directory on your search path, but in this case it must be
explicitly requested with a `-I' switch.

<p>Specifying the switch `-nostdinc'
inhibits the search of the default location for the GNAT Run Time
Library (RTL) source files.

<p>The compiler outputs its object files and ALI files in the current
working directory. 
Caution: The object file can be redirected with the `-o' switch;
however, `gcc' and <cite>gnat1</cite> have not been coordinated on this
so the <code>ALI</code> file will not go to the right place. Therefore, you should
avoid using the `-o' switch.

<p><a name="index-System_002eIO-251"></a>
The packages <cite>Ada</cite>, <cite>System</cite>, and <cite>Interfaces</cite> and their
children make up the GNAT RTL, together with the simple <cite>System.IO</cite>
package used in the <cite>"Hello World"</cite> example. The sources for these units
are needed by the compiler and are kept together in one directory. Not
all of the bodies are needed, but all of the sources are kept together
anyway. In a normal installation, you need not specify these directory
names when compiling or binding. Either the environment variables or
the built-in defaults cause these files to be found.

<p>In addition to the language-defined hierarchies (<cite>System</cite>, <cite>Ada</cite> and
<cite>Interfaces</cite>), the GNAT distribution provides a fourth hierarchy,
consisting of child units of <cite>GNAT</cite>. This is a collection of generally
useful types, subprograms, etc. See the <cite>GNAT_Reference_Manual</cite>
for further details.

<p>Besides simplifying access to the RTL, a major use of search paths is
in compiling sources from multiple directories. This can make
development environments much more flexible.
