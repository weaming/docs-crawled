<h5 class="subsubsection">8.3.1.11 Atomic Variables and Optimization</h5>

<p><a name="index-Atomic-1017"></a>
There are two considerations with regard to performance when
atomic variables are used.

<p>First, the RM only guarantees that access to atomic variables
be atomic, it has nothing to say about how this is achieved,
though there is a strong implication that this should not be
achieved by explicit locking code. Indeed GNAT will never
generate any locking code for atomic variable access (it will
simply reject any attempt to make a variable or type atomic
if the atomic access cannot be achieved without such locking code).

<p>That being said, it is important to understand that you cannot
assume that the entire variable will always be accessed. Consider
this example:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    type R is record
       A,B,C,D : Character;
    end record;
    for R'Size use 32;
    for R'Alignment use 4;
    
    RV : R;
    pragma Atomic (RV);
    X : Character;
    ...
    X := RV.B;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot assume that the reference to <cite>RV.B</cite>
will read the entire 32-bit
variable with a single load instruction. It is perfectly legitimate if
the hardware allows it to do a byte read of just the B field. This read
is still atomic, which is all the RM requires. GNAT can and does take
advantage of this, depending on the architecture and optimization level. 
Any assumption to the contrary is non-portable and risky. Even if you
examine the assembly language and see a full 32-bit load, this might
change in a future version of the compiler.

<p>If your application requires that all accesses to <cite>RV</cite> in this
example be full 32-bit loads, you need to make a copy for the access
as in:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    declare
       RV_Copy : constant R := RV;
    begin
       X := RV_Copy.B;
    end;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the reference to RV must read the whole variable. 
Actually one can imagine some compiler which figures
out that the whole copy is not required (because only
the B field is actually accessed), but GNAT
certainly won't do that, and we don't know of any
compiler that would not handle this right, and the
above code will in practice work portably across
all architectures (that permit the Atomic declaration).

<p>The second issue with atomic variables has to do with
the possible requirement of generating synchronization
code. For more details on this, consult the sections on
the pragmas Enable/Disable_Atomic_Synchronization in the
GNAT Reference Manual. If performance is critical, and
such synchronization code is not required, it may be
useful to disable it.
