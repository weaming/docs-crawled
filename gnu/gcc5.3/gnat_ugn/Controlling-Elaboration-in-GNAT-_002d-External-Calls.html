<h3 class="section">11.5 Controlling Elaboration in GNAT - External Calls</h3>

<p>The previous section discussed the case in which the execution of a
particular thread of elaboration code occurred entirely within a
single unit. This is the easy case to handle, because a programmer
has direct and total control over the order of elaboration, and
furthermore, checks need only be generated in cases which are rare
and which the compiler can easily detect. 
The situation is more complex when separate compilation is taken into account. 
Consider the following:

<pre class="example">    package Math is
       function Sqrt (Arg : Float) return Float;
    end Math;
    
    package body Math is
       function Sqrt (Arg : Float) return Float is
       begin
             ...
       end Sqrt;
    end Math;
    
    with Math;
    package Stuff is
       X : Float := Math.Sqrt (0.5);
    end Stuff;
    
    with Stuff;
    procedure Main is
    begin
       ...
    end Main;
</pre>
<p>where <cite>Main</cite> is the main program. When this program is executed, the
elaboration code must first be executed, and one of the jobs of the
binder is to determine the order in which the units of a program are
to be elaborated. In this case we have four units: the spec and body
of <cite>Math</cite>,
the spec of <cite>Stuff</cite> and the body of <cite>Main</cite>). 
In what order should the four separate sections of elaboration code
be executed?

<p>There are some restrictions in the order of elaboration that the binder
can choose. In particular, if unit U has a `with'
for a package <cite>X</cite>, then you
are assured that the spec of <cite>X</cite>
is elaborated before U , but you are
not assured that the body of <cite>X</cite>
is elaborated before U. 
This means that in the above case, the binder is allowed to choose the
order:

<pre class="example">    spec of Math
    spec of Stuff
    body of Math
    body of Main
</pre>
<p>but that's not good, because now the call to <cite>Math.Sqrt</cite>
that happens during
the elaboration of the <cite>Stuff</cite>
spec happens before the body of <cite>Math.Sqrt</cite> is
elaborated, and hence causes <cite>Program_Error</cite> exception to be raised. 
At first glance, one might say that the binder is misbehaving, because
obviously you want to elaborate the body of something you `with' first, but
that is not a general rule that can be followed in all cases. Consider

<pre class="example">    package X is ...
    
    package Y is ...
    
    with X;
    package body Y is ...
    
    with Y;
    package body X is ...
</pre>
<p>This is a common arrangement, and, apart from the order of elaboration
problems that might arise in connection with elaboration code, this works fine. 
A rule that says that you must first elaborate the body of anything you
`with' cannot work in this case:
the body of <cite>X</cite> `with's <cite>Y</cite>,
which means you would have to
elaborate the body of <cite>Y</cite> first, but that `with's <cite>X</cite>,
which means
you have to elaborate the body of <cite>X</cite> first, but ... and we have a
loop that cannot be broken.

<p>It is true that the binder can in many cases guess an order of elaboration
that is unlikely to cause a <cite>Program_Error</cite>
exception to be raised, and it tries to do so (in the
above example of <cite>Math/Stuff/Spec</cite>, the GNAT binder will
by default
elaborate the body of <cite>Math</cite> right after its spec, so all will be well).

<p>However, a program that blindly relies on the binder to be helpful can
get into trouble, as we discussed in the previous sections, so GNAT
provides a number of facilities for assisting the programmer in
developing programs that are robust with respect to elaboration order.
