<h4 class="subsection">5.7.6 package Builder in aggregate projects</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, only the package Builder can be specified in
an aggregate project. In this package, only the following attributes
are valid:

<p><a name="index-Switches-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-855"></a>
`Switches':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute gives the list of switches to use for `gprbuild'. 
Because no mains can be specified for aggregate projects, the only possible
index for attribute <cite>Switches</cite> is <cite>others</cite>. All other indexes will
be ignored.

<p>Example:

<pre class="example">    for Switches (others) use ("-v", "-k", "-j8");
</pre>
<p>These switches are only read from the main aggregate project (the
one passed on the command line), and ignored in all other aggregate
projects or projects.

<p>It can only contain builder switches, not compiler switches. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Global_005fCompilation_005fSwitches-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-856"></a>
`Global_Compilation_Switches'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute gives the list of compiler switches for the various
languages. For instance,

<pre class="example">    for Global_Compilation_Switches ("Ada") use ("O1", "-g");
    for Global_Compilation_Switches ("C")   use ("-O2");
</pre>
<p>This attribute is only taken into account in the aggregate project
specified on the command line, not in other aggregate projects.

<p>In the projects grouped by that aggregate, the attribute
Builder.Global_Compilation_Switches is also ignored. However, the
attribute Compiler.Default_Switches will be taken into account (but
that of the aggregate have higher priority). The attribute
Compiler.Switches is also taken into account and can be used to
override the switches for a specific file. As a result, it always
has priority.

<p>The rules are meant to avoid ambiguities when compiling. For
instance, aggregate project Agg groups the projects A and B, that
both depend on C. Here is an extra for all of these projects:

<pre class="example">    aggregate project Agg is
        for Project_Files use ("a.gpr", "b.gpr");
        package Builder is
           for Global_Compilation_Switches ("Ada") use ("-O2");
        end Builder;
    end Agg;
    
    with "c.gpr";
    project A is
        package Builder is
           for Global_Compilation_Switches ("Ada") use ("-O1");
           --  ignored
        end Builder;
    
        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada")
               use ("-O1", "-g");
           for Switches ("a_file1.adb")
               use ("-O0");
        end Compiler;
    end A;
    
    with "c.gpr";
    project B is
        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-O0");
        end Compiler;
    end B;
    
    project C is
        package Compiler is
           for Default_Switches ("Ada")
               use ("-O3",
                    "-gnatn");
           for Switches ("c_file1.adb")
               use ("-O0", "-g");
        end Compiler;
    end C;
</pre>
<p>then the following switches are used:

     <ul>
<li>all files from project A except a_file1.adb are compiled
with "-O2 -g", since the aggregate project has priority.

     <li>the file a_file1.adb is compiled with
"-O0", since the Compiler.Switches has priority

     <li>all files from project B are compiled with
"-O2", since the aggregate project has priority

     <li>all files from C are compiled with "-O2 -gnatn", except for
c_file1.adb which is compiled with "-O0 -g"
</ul>

<p>Even though C is seen through two paths (through A and through
B), the switches used by the compiler are unambiguous. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Global_005fConfiguration_005fPragmas-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-857"></a>
`Global_Configuration_Pragmas'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute can be used to specify a file containing
configuration pragmas, to be passed to the Ada compiler.  Since we
ignore the package Builder in other aggregate projects and projects,
only those pragmas defined in the main aggregate project will be
taken into account.

<p>Projects can locally add to those by using the
<cite>Compiler.Local_Configuration_Pragmas</cite> attribute if they need. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Global_005fConfig_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-858"></a>
`Global_Config_File'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute, indexed with a language name, can be used to specify a config
when compiling sources of the language. For Ada, these files are configuration
pragmas files. 
</blockquote>

<p>For projects that are built through the aggregate, the package Builder
is ignored, except for the Executable attribute which specifies the
name of the executables resulting from the link of the main programs, and
for the Executable_Suffix.
