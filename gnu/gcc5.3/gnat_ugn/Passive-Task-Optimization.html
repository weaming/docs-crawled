<h5 class="subsubsection">8.3.1.12 Passive Task Optimization</h5>

<p><a name="index-Passive-Task-1018"></a>
A passive task is one which is sufficiently simple that
in theory a compiler could recognize it an implement it
efficiently without creating a new thread. The original design
of Ada 83 had in mind this kind of passive task optimization, but
only a few Ada 83 compilers attempted it. The problem was that
it was difficult to determine the exact conditions under which
the optimization was possible. The result is a very fragile
optimization where a very minor change in the program can
suddenly silently make a task non-optimizable.

<p>With the revisiting of this issue in Ada 95, there was general
agreement that this approach was fundamentally flawed, and the
notion of protected types was introduced. When using protected
types, the restrictions are well defined, and you KNOW that the
operations will be optimized, and furthermore this optimized
performance is fully portable.

<p>Although it would theoretically be possible for GNAT to attempt to
do this optimization, but it really doesn't make sense in the
context of Ada 95, and none of the Ada 95 compilers implement
this optimization as far as we know. In particular GNAT never
attempts to perform this optimization.

<p>In any new Ada 95 code that is written, you should always
use protected types in place of tasks that might be able to
be optimized in this manner. 
Of course this does not help if you have legacy Ada 83 code
that depends on this optimization, but it is unusual to encounter
a case where the performance gains from this optimization
are significant.

<p>Your program should work correctly without this optimization. If
you have performance problems, then the most practical
approach is to figure out exactly where these performance problems
arise, and update those particular tasks to be protected types. Note
that typically clients of the tasks who call entries, will not have
to be modified, only the task definition itself.
