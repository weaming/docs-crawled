<h4 class="subsection">8.4.1 Background</h4>

<p>Overflow checks are checks that the compiler may make to ensure
that intermediate results are not out of range. For example:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    A : Integer;
    ...
    A := A + 1;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If <cite>A</cite> has the value <cite>Integer'Last</cite>, then the addition may cause
overflow since the result is out of range of the type <cite>Integer</cite>. 
In this case <cite>Constraint_Error</cite> will be raised if checks are
enabled.

<p>A trickier situation arises in examples like the following:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    A, C : Integer;
    ...
    A := (A + 1) + C;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where <cite>A</cite> is <cite>Integer'Last</cite> and <cite>C</cite> is <cite>-1</cite>. 
Now the final result of the expression on the right hand side is
<cite>Integer'Last</cite> which is in range, but the question arises whether the
intermediate addition of <cite>(A + 1)</cite> raises an overflow error.

<p>The (perhaps surprising) answer is that the Ada language
definition does not answer this question. Instead it leaves
it up to the implementation to do one of two things if overflow
checks are enabled.

     <ul>
<li>raise an exception (<cite>Constraint_Error</cite>), or

     <li>yield the correct mathematical result which is then used in
subsequent operations. 
</ul>

<p>If the compiler chooses the first approach, then the assignment of this
example will indeed raise <cite>Constraint_Error</cite> if overflow checking is
enabled, or result in erroneous execution if overflow checks are suppressed.

<p>But if the compiler
chooses the second approach, then it can perform both additions yielding
the correct mathematical result, which is in range, so no exception
will be raised, and the right result is obtained, regardless of whether
overflow checks are suppressed.

<p>Note that in the first example an
exception will be raised in either case, since if the compiler
gives the correct mathematical result for the addition, it will
be out of range of the target type of the assignment, and thus
fails the range check.

<p>This lack of specified behavior in the handling of overflow for
intermediate results is a source of non-portability, and can thus
be problematic when programs are ported. Most typically this arises
in a situation where the original compiler did not raise an exception,
and then the application is moved to a compiler where the check is
performed on the intermediate result and an unexpected exception is
raised.

<p>Furthermore, when using Ada 2012's preconditions and other
assertion forms, another issue arises. Consider:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    procedure P (A, B : Integer) with
      Pre =&gt; A + B &lt;= Integer'Last;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One often wants to regard arithmetic in a context like this from
a mathematical point of view. So for example, if the two actual parameters
for a call to <cite>P</cite> are both <cite>Integer'Last</cite>, then
the precondition should be regarded as False. If we are executing
in a mode with run-time checks enabled for preconditions, then we would
like this precondition to fail, rather than raising an exception
because of the intermediate overflow.

<p>However, the language definition leaves the specification of
whether the above condition fails (raising <cite>Assert_Error</cite>) or
causes an intermediate overflow (raising <cite>Constraint_Error</cite>)
up to the implementation.

<p>The situation is worse in a case such as the following:

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    procedure Q (A, B, C : Integer) with
      Pre =&gt; A + B + C &lt;= Integer'Last;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the call

<blockquote>

<pre class="example">    Q (A =&gt; Integer'Last, B =&gt; 1, C =&gt; -1);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>From a mathematical point of view the precondition
is True, but at run time we may (but are not guaranteed to) get an
exception raised because of the intermediate overflow (and we really
would prefer this precondition to be considered True at run time).
