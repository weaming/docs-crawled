<h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 Sharing Between Projects</h4>

<p>When building an application, it is common to have similar needs in several of
the projects corresponding to the subsystems under construction. For instance,
they will all have the same compilation switches.

<p>As seen before (see <a href="15e.html#g_t15e">Tools Options in Project Files</a>), setting compilation
switches for all sources of a subsystem is simple: it is just a matter of
adding a <cite>Compiler.Default_Switches</cite> attribute to each project files with
the same value. Of course, that means duplication of data, and both places need
to be changed in order to recompile the whole application with different
switches. It can become a real problem if there are many subsystems and thus
many project files to edit.

<p>There are two main approaches to avoiding this duplication:

     <ul>
<li>Since <code>build.gpr</code> imports <code>logging.gpr</code>, we could change it
to reference the attribute in Logging, either through a package renaming,
or by referencing the attribute. The following example shows both cases:

     <pre class="example">         project Logging is
            package Compiler is
               for Switches ("Ada")
                   use ("-O2");
            end Compiler;
            package Binder is
               for Switches ("Ada")
                   use ("-E");
            end Binder;
         end Logging;
         
         with "logging.gpr";
         project Build is
            package Compiler renames Logging.Compiler;
            package Binder is
               for Switches ("Ada") use Logging.Binder'Switches ("Ada");
            end Binder;
         end Build;
</pre>
     <p>The solution used for <cite>Compiler</cite> gets the same value for all
attributes of the package, but you cannot modify anything from the
package (adding extra switches or some exceptions). The second
version is more flexible, but more verbose.

     <p>If you need to refer to the value of a variable in an imported
project, rather than an attribute, the syntax is similar but uses
a "." rather than an apostrophe. For instance:

     <pre class="example">         with "imported";
         project Main is
            Var1 := Imported.Var;
         end Main;
</pre>
     <li>The second approach is to define the switches in a third project. 
That project is set up without any sources (so that, as opposed to
the first example, none of the project plays a special role), and
will only be used to define the attributes. Such a project is
typically called <code>shared.gpr</code>.

     <pre class="example">         abstract project Shared is
            for Source_Files use ();   --  no sources
            package Compiler is
               for Switches ("Ada")
                   use ("-O2");
            end Compiler;
         end Shared;
         
         with "shared.gpr";
         project Logging is
            package Compiler renames Shared.Compiler;
         end Logging;
         
         with "shared.gpr";
         project Build is
            package Compiler renames Shared.Compiler;
         end Build;
</pre>
     <p>As for the first example, we could have chosen to set the attributes
one by one rather than to rename a package. The reason we explicitly
indicate that <cite>Shared</cite> has no sources is so that it can be created
in any directory and we are sure it shares no sources with <cite>Build</cite>
or <cite>Logging</cite>, which of course would be invalid.

     <p><a name="index-project-qualifier-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-823"></a>
Note the additional use of the `abstract' qualifier in <code>shared.gpr</code>. 
This qualifier is optional, but helps convey the message that we do not
intend this project to have sources (see <a href="173.html#g_t173">Qualified Projects</a> for
more qualifiers). 
</ul>
