<h4 class="subsection">3.9.1 Introduction to Libraries in GNAT</h4>

<p>A library is, conceptually, a collection of objects which does not have its
own main thread of execution, but rather provides certain services to the
applications that use it. A library can be either statically linked with the
application, in which case its code is directly included in the application,
or, on platforms that support it, be dynamically linked, in which case
its code is shared by all applications making use of this library.

<p>GNAT supports both types of libraries. 
In the static case, the compiled code can be provided in different ways. The
simplest approach is to provide directly the set of objects resulting from
compilation of the library source files. Alternatively, you can group the
objects into an archive using whatever commands are provided by the operating
system. For the latter case, the objects are grouped into a shared library.

<p>In the GNAT environment, a library has three types of components:

     <ul>
<li>Source files,

     <li><code>ALI</code> files (see <a href="44.html#g_t44">The Ada Library Information Files</a>), and

     <li>Object files, an archive or a shared library. 
</ul>

<p>A GNAT library may expose all its source files, which is useful for
documentation purposes. Alternatively, it may expose only the units needed by
an external user to make use of the library. That is to say, the specs
reflecting the library services along with all the units needed to compile
those specs, which can include generic bodies or any body implementing an
inlined routine. In the case of `stand-alone libraries' those exposed
units are called `interface units' (<a href="85.html#g_t85">Stand-alone Ada Libraries</a>).

<p>All compilation units comprising an application, including those in a library,
need to be elaborated in an order partially defined by Ada's semantics. GNAT
computes the elaboration order from the <code>ALI</code> files and this is why they
constitute a mandatory part of GNAT libraries. 
`Stand-alone libraries' are the exception to this rule because a specific
library elaboration routine is produced independently of the application(s)
using the library.
