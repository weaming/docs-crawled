<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 Switches for `gnatmake'</h4>

<p>You may specify any of the following switches to `gnatmake':

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dversion-_0028gnatmake_0029-175"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--version</code><dd>
Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other options. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dhelp-_0028gnatmake_0029-176"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--help</code><dd>
If <code>--version</code> was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
all other options. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dGCC_003dcompiler_005fname-_0028gnatmake_0029-177"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--GCC=`compiler_name'</code><dd>
Program used for compiling. The default is <code>gcc</code>. You need to use
quotes around <cite>compiler_name</cite> if <cite>compiler_name</cite> contains
spaces or other separator characters. 
As an example <code>--GCC="foo -x  -y"</code>
will instruct `gnatmake' to use <code>foo -x -y</code> as your
compiler. A limitation of this syntax is that the name and path name of
the executable itself must not include any embedded spaces. Note that
switch <code>-c</code> is always inserted after your command name. Thus in the
above example the compiler command that will be used by `gnatmake'
will be <code>foo -c -x -y</code>. If several <code>--GCC=compiler_name</code> are
used, only the last <cite>compiler_name</cite> is taken into account. However,
all the additional switches are also taken into account. Thus,
<code>--GCC="foo -x -y" --GCC="bar -z -t"</code> is equivalent to
<code>--GCC="bar -x -y -z -t"</code>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dGNATBIND_003dbinder_005fname-_0028gnatmake_0029-178"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--GNATBIND=`binder_name'</code><dd>
Program used for binding. The default is <code>gnatbind</code>. You need to
use quotes around <cite>binder_name</cite> if <cite>binder_name</cite> contains spaces
or other separator characters. 
As an example <code>--GNATBIND="bar -x  -y"</code>
will instruct `gnatmake' to use <cite>bar -x -y</cite> as your
binder. Binder switches that are normally appended by `gnatmake'
to <code>gnatbind</code> are now appended to the end of <cite>bar -x -y</cite>. 
A limitation of this syntax is that the name and path name of the executable
itself must not include any embedded spaces. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dGNATLINK_003dlinker_005fname-_0028gnatmake_0029-179"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--GNATLINK=`linker_name'</code><dd>
Program used for linking. The default is <code>gnatlink</code>. You need to
use quotes around <cite>linker_name</cite> if <cite>linker_name</cite> contains spaces
or other separator characters. 
As an example <code>--GNATLINK="lan -x  -y"</code>
will instruct `gnatmake' to use <code>lan -x -y</code> as your
linker. Linker switches that are normally appended by <code>gnatmake</code> to
<code>gnatlink</code> are now appended to the end of <code>lan -x -y</code>. 
A limitation of this syntax is that the name and path name of the executable
itself must not include any embedded spaces.

     <br><dt><code>--create-map-file</code><dd>
When linking an executable, create a map file. The name of the map file
has the same name as the executable with extension ".map".

     <br><dt><code>--create-map-file=`mapfile'</code><dd>
When linking an executable, create a map file with the specified name. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002dcreate_002dmissing_002ddirs-_0028gnatmake_0029-180"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>--create-missing-dirs</code><dd>
When using project files (<code>-P`project'</code>), automatically create
missing object directories, library directories and exec
directories.

     <br><dt><code>--single-compile-per-obj-dir</code><dd>
Disallow simultaneous compilations in the same object directory when
project files are used.

     <br><dt><code>--subdirs=`subdir'</code><dd>
Actual object directory of each project file is the subdirectory subdir of the
object directory specified or defaulted in the project file.

     <br><dt><code>--unchecked-shared-lib-imports</code><dd>
By default, shared library projects are not allowed to import static library
projects. When this switch is used on the command line, this restriction is
relaxed.

     <br><dt><code>--source-info=`source info file'</code><dd>
Specify a source info file. This switch is active only when project files
are used. If the source info file is specified as a relative path, then it is
relative to the object directory of the main project. If the source info file
does not exist, then after the Project Manager has successfully parsed and
processed the project files and found the sources, it creates the source info
file. If the source info file already exists and can be read successfully,
then the Project Manager will get all the needed information about the sources
from the source info file and will not look for them. This reduces the time
to process the project files, especially when looking for sources that take a
long time. If the source info file exists but cannot be parsed successfully,
the Project Manager will attempt to recreate it. If the Project Manager fails
to create the source info file, a message is issued, but gnatmake does not
fail. `gnatmake' "trusts" the source info file. This means that
if the source files have changed (addition, deletion, moving to a different
source directory), then the source info file need to be deleted and recreated. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002da-_0028gnatmake_0029-181"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a</code><dd>
Consider all files in the make process, even the GNAT internal system
files (for example, the predefined Ada library files), as well as any
locked files. Locked files are files whose ALI file is write-protected. 
By default,
`gnatmake' does not check these files,
because the assumption is that the GNAT internal files are properly up
to date, and also that any write protected ALI files have been properly
installed. Note that if there is an installation problem, such that one
of these files is not up to date, it will be properly caught by the
binder. 
You may have to specify this switch if you are working on GNAT
itself. The switch <code>-a</code> is also useful
in conjunction with <code>-f</code>
if you need to recompile an entire application,
including run-time files, using special configuration pragmas,
such as a <cite>Normalize_Scalars</cite> pragma.

     <p>By default
<code>gnatmake -a</code> compiles all GNAT
internal files with
<code>gcc -c -gnatpg</code> rather than <code>gcc -c</code>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002db-_0028gnatmake_0029-182"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-b</code><dd>
Bind only. Can be combined with `-c' to do
compilation and binding, but no link. 
Can be combined with `-l'
to do binding and linking. When not combined with
`-c'
all the units in the closure of the main program must have been previously
compiled and must be up to date. The root unit specified by <cite>file_name</cite>
may be given without extension, with the source extension or, if no GNAT
Project File is specified, with the ALI file extension. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dc-_0028gnatmake_0029-183"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd>
Compile only. Do not perform binding, except when `-b'
is also specified. Do not perform linking, except if both
`-b' and
`-l' are also specified. 
If the root unit specified by <cite>file_name</cite> is not a main unit, this is the
default. Otherwise `gnatmake' will attempt binding and linking
unless all objects are up to date and the executable is more recent than
the objects. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dC-_0028gnatmake_0029-184"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-C</code><dd>
Use a temporary mapping file. A mapping file is a way to communicate
to the compiler two mappings: from unit names to file names (without
any directory information) and from file names to path names (with
full directory information). A mapping file can make the compiler's
file searches faster, especially if there are many source directories,
or the sources are read over a slow network connection. If
`-P' is used, a mapping file is always used, so
`-C' is unnecessary; in this case the mapping file
is initially populated based on the project file. If
`-C' is used without
`-P',
the mapping file is initially empty. Each invocation of the compiler
will add any newly accessed sources to the mapping file. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dC_003d-_0028gnatmake_0029-185"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-C=`file'</code><dd>
Use a specific mapping file. The file, specified as a path name (absolute or
relative) by this switch, should already exist, otherwise the switch is
ineffective. The specified mapping file will be communicated to the compiler. 
This switch is not compatible with a project file
(-P`file`) or with multiple compiling processes
(-jnnn, when nnn is greater than 1). 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dd-_0028gnatmake_0029-186"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-d</code><dd>
Display progress for each source, up to date or not, as a single line:

     <pre class="example">         completed x out of y (zz%)
</pre>
     <p>If the file needs to be compiled this is displayed after the invocation of
the compiler. These lines are displayed even in quiet output mode. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dD-_0028gnatmake_0029-187"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-D `dir'</code><dd>
Put all object files and ALI file in directory <cite>dir</cite>. 
If the `-D' switch is not used, all object files
and ALI files go in the current working directory.

     <p>This switch cannot be used when using a project file. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002deI-_0028gnatmake_0029-188"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-eI`nnn'</code><dd>
Indicates that the main source is a multi-unit source and the rank of the unit
in the source file is nnn. nnn needs to be a positive number and a valid
index in the source. This switch cannot be used when `gnatmake' is
invoked for several mains. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002deL-_0028gnatmake_0029-189"></a>
<a name="index-symbolic-links-190"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-eL</code><dd>
Follow all symbolic links when processing project files. 
This should be used if your project uses symbolic links for files or
directories, but is not needed in other cases.

     <p><a name="index-naming-scheme-191"></a>
This also assumes that no directory matches the naming scheme for files (for
instance that you do not have a directory called "sources.ads" when using the
default GNAT naming scheme).

     <p>When you do not have to use this switch (i.e., by default), gnatmake is able to
save a lot of system calls (several per source file and object file), which
can result in a significant speed up to load and manipulate a project file,
especially when using source files from a remote system. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002deS-_0028gnatmake_0029-192"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-eS</code><dd>
Output the commands for the compiler, the binder and the linker
on standard output,
instead of standard error. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002df-_0028gnatmake_0029-193"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-f</code><dd>
Force recompilations. Recompile all sources, even though some object
files may be up to date, but don't recompile predefined or GNAT internal
files or locked files (files with a write-protected ALI file),
unless the `-a' switch is also specified. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dF-_0028gnatmake_0029-194"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-F</code><dd>
When using project files, if some errors or warnings are detected during
parsing and verbose mode is not in effect (no use of switch
-v), then error lines start with the full path name of the project
file, rather than its simple file name. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dg-_0028gnatmake_0029-195"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-g</code><dd>
Enable debugging. This switch is simply passed to the compiler and to the
linker. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002di-_0028gnatmake_0029-196"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-i</code><dd>
In normal mode, `gnatmake' compiles all object files and ALI files
into the current directory. If the `-i' switch is used,
then instead object files and ALI files that already exist are overwritten
in place. This means that once a large project is organized into separate
directories in the desired manner, then `gnatmake' will automatically
maintain and update this organization. If no ALI files are found on the
Ada object path (see <a href="8e.html#g_t8e">Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL)</a>),
the new object and ALI files are created in the
directory containing the source being compiled. If another organization
is desired, where objects and sources are kept in different directories,
a useful technique is to create dummy ALI files in the desired directories. 
When detecting such a dummy file, `gnatmake' will be forced to
recompile the corresponding source file, and it will be put the resulting
object and ALI files in the directory where it found the dummy file. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dj-_0028gnatmake_0029-197"></a>
<a name="index-Parallel-make-198"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-j`n'</code><dd>
Use <cite>n</cite> processes to carry out the (re)compilations. On a multiprocessor
machine compilations will occur in parallel. If <cite>n</cite> is 0, then the
maximum number of parallel compilations is the number of core processors
on the platform. In the event of compilation errors, messages from various
compilations might get interspersed (but `gnatmake' will give you the
full ordered list of failing compiles at the end). If this is problematic,
rerun the make process with n set to 1 to get a clean list of messages. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dk-_0028gnatmake_0029-199"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-k</code><dd>
Keep going. Continue as much as possible after a compilation error. To
ease the programmer's task in case of compilation errors, the list of
sources for which the compile fails is given when `gnatmake'
terminates.

     <p>If `gnatmake' is invoked with several <code>file_names</code> and with this
switch, if there are compilation errors when building an executable,
`gnatmake' will not attempt to build the following executables. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dl-_0028gnatmake_0029-200"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-l</code><dd>
Link only. Can be combined with `-b' to binding
and linking. Linking will not be performed if combined with
`-c'
but not with `-b'. 
When not combined with `-b'
all the units in the closure of the main program must have been previously
compiled and must be up to date, and the main program needs to have been bound. 
The root unit specified by <cite>file_name</cite>
may be given without extension, with the source extension or, if no GNAT
Project File is specified, with the ALI file extension. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dm-_0028gnatmake_0029-201"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-m</code><dd>
Specify that the minimum necessary amount of recompilations
be performed. In this mode `gnatmake' ignores time
stamp differences when the only
modifications to a source file consist in adding/removing comments,
empty lines, spaces or tabs. This means that if you have changed the
comments in a source file or have simply reformatted it, using this
switch will tell `gnatmake' not to recompile files that depend on it
(provided other sources on which these files depend have undergone no
semantic modifications). Note that the debugging information may be
out of date with respect to the sources if the `-m' switch causes
a compilation to be switched, so the use of this switch represents a
trade-off between compilation time and accurate debugging information. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-Dependencies-202"></a><a name="index-producing-list-203"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_002dM-_0028gnatmake_0029-204"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-M</code><dd>
Check if all objects are up to date. If they are, output the object
dependences to <code>stdout</code> in a form that can be directly exploited in
a <code>Makefile</code>. By default, each source file is prefixed with its
(relative or absolute) directory name. This name is whatever you
specified in the various `-aI'
and `-I' switches. If you use
<cite>gnatmake -M</cite>  `-q'
(see below), only the source file names,
without relative paths, are output. If you just specify the  `-M'
switch, dependencies of the GNAT internal system files are omitted. This
is typically what you want. If you also specify
the `-a' switch,
dependencies of the GNAT internal files are also listed. Note that
dependencies of the objects in external Ada libraries (see
switch  <code>-aL`dir'</code> in the following list)
are never reported. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dn-_0028gnatmake_0029-205"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-n</code><dd>
Don't compile, bind, or link. Checks if all objects are up to date. 
If they are not, the full name of the first file that needs to be
recompiled is printed. 
Repeated use of this option, followed by compiling the indicated source
file, will eventually result in recompiling all required units. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002do-_0028gnatmake_0029-206"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-o `exec_name'</code><dd>
Output executable name. The name of the final executable program will be
<cite>exec_name</cite>. If the `-o' switch is omitted the default
name for the executable will be the name of the input file in appropriate form
for an executable file on the host system.

     <p>This switch cannot be used when invoking `gnatmake' with several
<code>file_names</code>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dp-_0028gnatmake_0029-207"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-p</code><dd>
Same as <code>--create-missing-dirs</code>
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dP-_0028gnatmake_0029-208"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-P`project'</code><dd>
Use project file <cite>project</cite>. Only one such switch can be used. 
<a href="e1.html#e1">gnatmake and Project Files</a>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dq-_0028gnatmake_0029-209"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-q</code><dd>
Quiet. When this flag is not set, the commands carried out by
`gnatmake' are displayed. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002ds-_0028gnatmake_0029-210"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-s</code><dd>
Recompile if compiler switches have changed since last compilation. 
All compiler switches but -I and -o are taken into account in the
following way:
orders between different 'first letter' switches are ignored, but
orders between same switches are taken into account. For example,
`-O -O2' is different than `-O2 -O', but `-g -O'
is equivalent to `-O -g'.

     <p>This switch is recommended when Integrated Preprocessing is used. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002du-_0028gnatmake_0029-211"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-u</code><dd>
Unique. Recompile at most the main files. It implies -c. Combined with
-f, it is equivalent to calling the compiler directly. Note that using
-u with a project file and no main has a special meaning
(<a href="e2.html#e2">Project Files and Main Subprograms</a>). 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dU-_0028gnatmake_0029-212"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-U</code><dd>
When used without a project file or with one or several mains on the command
line, is equivalent to -u. When used with a project file and no main
on the command line, all sources of all project files are checked and compiled
if not up to date, and libraries are rebuilt, if necessary. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dv-_0028gnatmake_0029-213"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-v</code><dd>
Verbose. Display the reason for all recompilations `gnatmake'
decides are necessary, with the highest verbosity level. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvl-_0028gnatmake_0029-214"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-vl</code><dd>
Verbosity level Low. Display fewer lines than in verbosity Medium. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvm-_0028gnatmake_0029-215"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-vm</code><dd>
Verbosity level Medium. Potentially display fewer lines than in verbosity High. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dvm-_0028gnatmake_0029-216"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-vh</code><dd>
Verbosity level High. Equivalent to -v.

     <br><dt><code>-vP`x'</code><dd>
Indicate the verbosity of the parsing of GNAT project files. 
See <a href="e3.html#e3">Switches Related to Project Files</a>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dx-_0028gnatmake_0029-217"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x</code><dd>
Indicate that sources that are not part of any Project File may be compiled. 
Normally, when using Project Files, only sources that are part of a Project
File may be compile. When this switch is used, a source outside of all Project
Files may be compiled. The ALI file and the object file will be put in the
object directory of the main Project. The compilation switches used will only
be those specified on the command line. Even when
`-x' is used, mains specified on the
command line need to be sources of a project file.

     <br><dt><code>-X`name'=`value'</code><dd>
Indicate that external variable <cite>name</cite> has the value <cite>value</cite>. 
The Project Manager will use this value for occurrences of
<cite>external(name)</cite> when parsing the project file. 
<a href="e3.html#e3">Switches Related to Project Files</a>. 
</dl>

<p><a name="index-g_t_002dz-_0028gnatmake_0029-218"></a>

     <dl>
<dt><code>-z</code><dd>
No main subprogram. Bind and link the program even if the unit name
given on the command line is a package name. The resulting executable
will execute the elaboration routines of the package and its closure,
then the finalization routines. 
</dl>

<h5 class="subsubheading">GCC switches</h5>

<p>Any uppercase or multi-character switch that is not a `gnatmake' switch
is passed to `gcc' (e.g., `-O', `-gnato,' etc.)

<h5 class="subsubheading">Source and library search path switches</h5>

<dt><code>-aI`dir'</code><dd>
When looking for source files also look in directory <cite>dir</cite>. 
The order in which source files search is undertaken is
described in <a href="8e.html#g_t8e">Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL)</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-aL`dir'</code><dd>
Consider <cite>dir</cite> as being an externally provided Ada library. 
Instructs `gnatmake' to skip compilation units whose <code>.ALI</code>
files have been located in directory <cite>dir</cite>. This allows you to have
missing bodies for the units in <cite>dir</cite> and to ignore out of date bodies
for the same units. You still need to specify
the location of the specs for these units by using the switches
<code>-aI`dir'</code>  or <code>-I`dir'</code>. 
Note: this switch is provided for compatibility with previous versions
of `gnatmake'. The easier method of causing standard libraries
to be excluded from consideration is to write-protect the corresponding
ALI files.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-L`dir'</code><dd>
Add directory <cite>dir</cite> to the list of directories in which the linker
will search for libraries. This is equivalent to
<code>-largs</code> <code>-L`dir'</code>. 
Furthermore, under Windows, the sources pointed to by the libraries path
set in the registry are not searched for.

<dt><code>--RTS=`rts-path'</code><dd>
Specifies the default location of the runtime library. GNAT looks for the
runtime
in the following directories, and stops as soon as a valid runtime is found
(<code>adainclude</code> or <code>ada_source_path</code>, and <code>adalib</code> or
<code>ada_object_path</code> present):

          <ul>
<li>`&lt;current directory&gt;/$rts_path'

          <li>`&lt;default-search-dir&gt;/$rts_path'

          <li>`&lt;default-search-dir&gt;/rts-$rts_path'

          <li>The selected path is handled like a normal RTS path. 
</ul>
