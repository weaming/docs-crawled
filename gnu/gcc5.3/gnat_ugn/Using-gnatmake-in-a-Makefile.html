<h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 Using gnatmake in a Makefile</h4>

<!-- index makefile (GNU make) -->
<p>Complex project organizations can be handled in a very powerful way by
using GNU make combined with gnatmake. For instance, here is a Makefile
which allows you to build each subsystem of a big project into a separate
shared library. Such a makefile allows you to significantly reduce the link
time of very big applications while maintaining full coherence at
each step of the build process.

<p>The list of dependencies are handled automatically by
`gnatmake'. The Makefile is simply used to call gnatmake in each of
the appropriate directories.

<p>Note that you should also read the example on how to automatically
create the list of directories
(<a href="141.html#g_t141">Automatically Creating a List of Directories</a>)
which might help you in case your project has a lot of subdirectories.

<pre class="example">    ## This Makefile is intended to be used with the following directory
    ## configuration:
    ##  - The sources are split into a series of csc (computer software components)
    ##    Each of these csc is put in its own directory.
    ##    Their name are referenced by the directory names.
    ##    They will be compiled into shared library (although this would also work
    ##    with static libraries
    ##  - The main program (and possibly other packages that do not belong to any
    ##    csc is put in the top level directory (where the Makefile is).
    ##       toplevel_dir __ first_csc  (sources) __ lib (will contain the library)
    ##                    \\_ second_csc (sources) __ lib (will contain the library)
    ##                    \\_ ...
    ## Although this Makefile is build for shared library, it is easy to modify
    ## to build partial link objects instead (modify the lines with -shared and
    ## gnatlink below)
    ##
    ## With this makefile, you can change any file in the system or add any new
    ## file, and everything will be recompiled correctly (only the relevant shared
    ## objects will be recompiled, and the main program will be re-linked).
    
    # The list of computer software component for your project. This might be
    # generated automatically.
    CSC_LIST=aa bb cc
    
    # Name of the main program (no extension)
    MAIN=main
    
    # If we need to build objects with -fPIC, uncomment the following line
    #NEED_FPIC=-fPIC
    
    # The following variable should give the directory containing libgnat.so
    # You can get this directory through 'gnatls -v'. This is usually the last
    # directory in the Object_Path.
    GLIB=...
    
    # The directories for the libraries
    # (This macro expands the list of CSC to the list of shared libraries, you
    # could simply use the expanded form:
    # LIB_DIR=aa/lib/libaa.so bb/lib/libbb.so cc/lib/libcc.so
    LIB_DIR=${foreach dir,${CSC_LIST},${dir}/lib/lib${dir}.so}
    
    ${MAIN}: objects ${LIB_DIR}
        gnatbind ${MAIN} ${CSC_LIST:%=-aO%/lib} -shared
        gnatlink ${MAIN} ${CSC_LIST:%=-l%}
    
    objects::
        # recompile the sources
        gnatmake -c -i ${MAIN}.adb ${NEED_FPIC} ${CSC_LIST:%=-I%}
    
    # Note: In a future version of GNAT, the following commands will be simplified
    # by a new tool, gnatmlib
    ${LIB_DIR}:
        mkdir -p ${dir $@ }
        cd ${dir $@ } &amp;&amp; gcc -shared -o ${notdir $@ } ../*.o -L${GLIB} -lgnat
        cd ${dir $@ } &amp;&amp; cp -f ../*.ali .
    
    # The dependencies for the modules
    # Note that we have to force the expansion of *.o, since in some cases
    # make won't be able to do it itself.
    aa/lib/libaa.so: ${wildcard aa/*.o}
    bb/lib/libbb.so: ${wildcard bb/*.o}
    cc/lib/libcc.so: ${wildcard cc/*.o}
    
    # Make sure all of the shared libraries are in the path before starting the
    # program
    run::
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/aa/lib:`pwd`/bb/lib:`pwd`/cc/lib ./${MAIN}
    
    clean::
        ${RM} -rf ${CSC_LIST:%=%/lib}
        ${RM} ${CSC_LIST:%=%/*.ali}
        ${RM} ${CSC_LIST:%=%/*.o}
        ${RM} *.o *.ali ${MAIN}
