<h5 class="subsubsection">9.3.5.6 Introduction to Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)</h5>

<p><a name="index-DLL-1088"></a>
A Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) is a library that can be shared by
several applications running under Windows. A DLL can contain any number of
routines and variables.

<p>One advantage of DLLs is that you can change and enhance them without
forcing all the applications that depend on them to be relinked or
recompiled. However, you should be aware than all calls to DLL routines are
slower since, as you will understand below, such calls are indirect.

<p>To illustrate the remainder of this section, suppose that an application
wants to use the services of a DLL <code>API.dll</code>. To use the services
provided by <code>API.dll</code> you must statically link against the DLL or
an import library which contains a jump table with an entry for each
routine and variable exported by the DLL. In the Microsoft world this
import library is called <code>API.lib</code>. When using GNAT this import
library is called either <code>libAPI.dll.a</code>, <code>libapi.dll.a</code>,
<code>libAPI.a</code> or <code>libapi.a</code> (names are case insensitive).

<p>After you have linked your application with the DLL or the import library
and you run your application, here is what happens:

     <ul>
<li>Your application is loaded into memory.

     <li>The DLL <code>API.dll</code> is mapped into the address space of your
application. This means that:

          <ul>
<li>The DLL will use the stack of the calling thread.

          <li>The DLL will use the virtual address space of the calling process.

          <li>The DLL will allocate memory from the virtual address space of the calling
process.

          <li>Handles (pointers) can be safely exchanged between routines in the DLL
routines and routines in the application using the DLL. 
</ul>

     <li>The entries in the jump table (from the import library <code>libAPI.dll.a</code>
or <code>API.lib</code> or automatically created when linking against a DLL)
which is part of your application are initialized with the addresses
of the routines and variables in <code>API.dll</code>.

     <li>If present in <code>API.dll</code>, routines <cite>DllMain</cite> or
<cite>DllMainCRTStartup</cite> are invoked. These routines typically contain
the initialization code needed for the well-being of the routines and
variables exported by the DLL. 
</ul>

<p>There is an additional point which is worth mentioning. In the Windows
world there are two kind of DLLs: relocatable and non-relocatable
DLLs. Non-relocatable DLLs can only be loaded at a very specific address
in the target application address space. If the addresses of two
non-relocatable DLLs overlap and these happen to be used by the same
application, a conflict will occur and the application will run
incorrectly. Hence, when possible, it is always preferable to use and
build relocatable DLLs. Both relocatable and non-relocatable DLLs are
supported by GNAT. Note that the `-s' linker option (see GNU Linker
User's Guide) removes the debugging symbols from the DLL but the DLL can
still be relocated.

<p>As a side note, an interesting difference between Microsoft DLLs and
Unix shared libraries, is the fact that on most Unix systems all public
routines are exported by default in a Unix shared library, while under
Windows it is possible (but not required) to list exported routines in
a definition file (see <a href="280.html#g_t280">The Definition File</a>).
