<h4 class="subsection">3.12.1 Comparison between GNAT and C/C++ Compilation Models</h4>

<p>The GNAT model of compilation is close to the C and C++ models. You can
think of Ada specs as corresponding to header files in C. As in C, you
don't need to compile specs; they are compiled when they are used. The
Ada `with' is similar in effect to the <cite>#include</cite> of a C
header.

<p>One notable difference is that, in Ada, you may compile specs separately
to check them for semantic and syntactic accuracy. This is not always
possible with C headers because they are fragments of programs that have
less specific syntactic or semantic rules.

<p>The other major difference is the requirement for running the binder,
which performs two important functions. First, it checks for
consistency. In C or C++, the only defense against assembling
inconsistent programs lies outside the compiler, in a makefile, for
example. The binder satisfies the Ada requirement that it be impossible
to construct an inconsistent program when the compiler is used in normal
mode.

<p><a name="index-Elaboration-order-control-169"></a>
The other important function of the binder is to deal with elaboration
issues. There are also elaboration issues in C++ that are handled
automatically. This automatic handling has the advantage of being
simpler to use, but the C++ programmer has no control over elaboration. 
Where <cite>gnatbind</cite> might complain there was no valid order of
elaboration, a C++ compiler would simply construct a program that
malfunctioned at run time.
