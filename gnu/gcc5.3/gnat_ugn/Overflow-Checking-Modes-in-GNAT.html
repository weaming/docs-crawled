<h4 class="subsection">8.4.2 Overflow Checking Modes in GNAT</h4>

<p>To deal with the portability issue, and with the problem of
mathematical versus run-time interpretation of the expressions in
assertions, GNAT provides comprehensive control over the handling
of intermediate overflow. GNAT can operate in three modes, and
furthemore, permits separate selection of operating modes for
the expressions within assertions (here the term 'assertions'
is used in the technical sense, which includes preconditions and so forth)
and for expressions appearing outside assertions.

<p>The three modes are:

     <ul>
<li>`Use base type for intermediate operations' (<cite>STRICT</cite>)

     <p>In this mode, all intermediate results for predefined arithmetic
operators are computed using the base type, and the result must
be in range of the base type. If this is not the
case then either an exception is raised (if overflow checks are
enabled) or the execution is erroneous (if overflow checks are suppressed). 
This is the normal default mode.

     <li>`Most intermediate overflows avoided' (<cite>MINIMIZED</cite>)

     <p>In this mode, the compiler attempts to avoid intermediate overflows by
using a larger integer type, typically <cite>Long_Long_Integer</cite>,
as the type in which arithmetic is
performed for predefined arithmetic operators. This may be slightly more
expensive at
run time (compared to suppressing intermediate overflow checks), though
the cost is negligible on modern 64-bit machines. For the examples given
earlier, no intermediate overflows would have resulted in exceptions,
since the intermediate results are all in the range of
<cite>Long_Long_Integer</cite> (typically 64-bits on nearly all implementations
of GNAT). In addition, if checks are enabled, this reduces the number of
checks that must be made, so this choice may actually result in an
improvement in space and time behavior.

     <p>However, there are cases where <cite>Long_Long_Integer</cite> is not large
enough, consider the following example:

     <blockquote>

     <pre class="example">         procedure R (A, B, C, D : Integer) with
           Pre =&gt; (A**2 * B**2) / (C**2 * D**2) &lt;= 10;
</pre>
     </blockquote>

     <p>where <cite>A</cite> = <cite>B</cite> = <cite>C</cite> = <cite>D</cite> = <cite>Integer'Last</cite>. 
Now the intermediate results are
out of the range of <cite>Long_Long_Integer</cite> even though the final result
is in range and the precondition is True (from a mathematical point
of view). In such a case, operating in this mode, an overflow occurs
for the intermediate computation (which is why this mode
says `most' intermediate overflows are avoided). In this case,
an exception is raised if overflow checks are enabled, and the
execution is erroneous if overflow checks are suppressed.

     <li>`All intermediate overflows avoided' (<cite>ELIMINATED</cite>)

     <p>In this mode, the compiler  avoids all intermediate overflows
by using arbitrary precision arithmetic as required. In this
mode, the above example with <cite>A**2 * B**2</cite> would
not cause intermediate overflow, because the intermediate result
would be evaluated using sufficient precision, and the result
of evaluating the precondition would be True.

     <p>This mode has the advantage of avoiding any intermediate
overflows, but at the expense of significant run-time overhead,
including the use of a library (included automatically in this
mode) for multiple-precision arithmetic.

     <p>This mode provides cleaner semantics for assertions, since now
the run-time behavior emulates true arithmetic behavior for the
predefined arithmetic operators, meaning that there is never a
conflict between the mathematical view of the assertion, and its
run-time behavior.

     <p>Note that in this mode, the behavior is unaffected by whether or
not overflow checks are suppressed, since overflow does not occur. 
It is possible for gigantic intermediate expressions to raise
<cite>Storage_Error</cite> as a result of attempting to compute the
results of such expressions (e.g. <cite>Integer'Last ** Integer'Last</cite>)
but overflow is impossible. 
</ul>

<p>Note that these modes apply only to the evaluation of predefined
arithmetic, membership, and comparison operators for signed integer
aritmetic.

<p>For fixed-point arithmetic, checks can be suppressed. But if checks
are enabled
then fixed-point values are always checked for overflow against the
base type for intermediate expressions (that is such checks always
operate in the equivalent of <cite>STRICT</cite> mode).

<p>For floating-point, on nearly all architectures, <cite>Machine_Overflows</cite>
is False, and IEEE infinities are generated, so overflow exceptions
are never raised. If you want to avoid infinities, and check that
final results of expressions are in range, then you can declare a
constrained floating-point type, and range checks will be carried
out in the normal manner (with infinite values always failing all
range checks).
