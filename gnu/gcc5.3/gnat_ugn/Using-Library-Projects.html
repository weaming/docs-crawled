<h4 class="subsection">5.5.2 Using Library Projects</h4>

<p>When the builder detects that a project file is a library project file, it
recompiles all sources of the project that need recompilation and rebuild the
library if any of the sources have been recompiled. It then groups all object
files into a single file, which is a shared or a static library. This library
can later on be linked with multiple executables. Note that the use
of shard libraries reduces the size of the final executable and can also reduce
the memory footprint at execution time when the library is shared among several
executables.

<p>It is also possible to build `multi-language libraries'. When using
`gprbuild' as a builder, multi-language library projects allow naturally
the creation of multi-language libraries . `gnatmake', does not try to
compile non Ada sources. However, when the project is multi-language, it will
automatically link all object files found in the object directory, whether or
not they were compiled from an Ada source file. This specific behavior does not
apply to Ada-only projects which only take into account the objects
corresponding to the sources of the project.

<p>A non-library project can import a library project. When the builder is invoked
on the former, the library of the latter is only rebuilt when absolutely
necessary. For instance, if a unit of the library is not up-to-date but none of
the executables need this unit, then the unit is not recompiled and the library
is not reassembled.  For instance, let's assume in our example that logging has
the following sources: <code>log1.ads</code>, <code>log1.adb</code>, <code>log2.ads</code> and
<code>log2.adb</code>. If <code>log1.adb</code> has been modified, then the library
<code>liblogging</code> will be rebuilt when compiling all the sources of
<cite>Build</cite> only if <code>proc.ads</code>, <code>pack.ads</code> or <code>pack.adb</code>
include a <cite>"with Log1"</cite>.

<p>To ensure that all the sources in the <cite>Logging</cite> library are
up to date, and that all the sources of <cite>Build</cite> are also up to date,
the following two commands need to be used:

<pre class="example">    gnatmake -Plogging.gpr
    gnatmake -Pbuild.gpr
</pre>
<p>All <code>ALI</code> files will also be copied from the object directory to the
library directory. To build executables, `gnatmake' will use the
library rather than the individual object files.

<p>Library projects can also be useful to describe a library that needs to be used
but, for some reason, cannot be rebuilt. For instance, it is the case when some
of the library sources are not available. Such library projects need to use the
<cite>Externally_Built</cite> attribute as in the example below:

<!-- code-block: ada-project -->
<!-- library project Extern_Lib is -->
<!-- for Languages    use ("Ada", "C"); -->
<!-- for Source_Dirs  use ("lib_src"); -->
<!-- for Library_Dir  use "lib2"; -->
<!-- for Library_Kind use "dynamic"; -->
<!-- for Library_Name use "l2"; -->
<!-- for Externally_Built use "true";  -  <<<< -->
<!-- end Extern_Lib; -->
<p>In the case of externally built libraries, the <cite>Object_Dir</cite>
attribute does not need to be specified because it will never be
used.

<p>The main effect of using such an externally built library project is mostly to
affect the linker command in order to reference the desired library. It can
also be achieved by using <cite>Linker.Linker_Options</cite> or <cite>Linker.Switches</cite>
in the project corresponding to the subsystem needing this external library. 
This latter method is more straightforward in simple cases but when several
subsystems depend upon the same external library, finding the proper place
for the <cite>Linker.Linker_Options</cite> might not be easy and if it is
not placed properly, the final link command is likely to present ordering issues. 
In such a situation, it is better to use the externally built library project
so that all other subsystems depending on it can declare this dependency thanks
to a project `with' clause, which in turn will trigger the builder to find
the proper order of libraries in the final link command.
