<h4 class="subsection">5.7.2 Building a set of projects with a single command</h4>

<p>One other case is when you have multiple applications and libraries
that are built independently from each other (but can be built in
parallel). For instance, you have a project tree rooted at A, and
another one (which might share some subprojects) rooted at B.

<p>Using only `gprbuild', you could do

<pre class="example">    gprbuild -PA.gpr
    gprbuild -PB.gpr
</pre>
<p>to build both. But again, `gprbuild' has to do some duplicate work for
those files that are shared between the two, and cannot truly build
things in parallel efficiently.

<p>If the two projects are really independent, share no sources other
than through a common subproject, and have no source files with a
common basename, you could create a project C that imports A and
B. But these restrictions are often too strong, and one has to build
them independently. An aggregate project does not have these
limitations and can aggregate two project trees that have common
sources.

<p>This scenario is particularly useful in environments like VxWorks 653
where the applications running in the multiple partitions can be built
in parallel through a single `gprbuild' command. This also works nicely
with Annex E.
