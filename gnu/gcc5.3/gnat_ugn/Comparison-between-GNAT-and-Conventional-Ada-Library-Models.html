<h4 class="subsection">3.12.2 Comparison between GNAT and Conventional Ada Library Models</h4>

<p>This section is intended for Ada programmers who have
used an Ada compiler implementing the traditional Ada library
model, as described in the Ada Reference Manual.

<p><a name="index-GNAT-library-170"></a>
In GNAT, there is no 'library' in the normal sense. Instead, the set of
source files themselves acts as the library. Compiling Ada programs does
not generate any centralized information, but rather an object file and
a ALI file, which are of interest only to the binder and linker. 
In a traditional system, the compiler reads information not only from
the source file being compiled, but also from the centralized library. 
This means that the effect of a compilation depends on what has been
previously compiled. In particular:

     <ul>
<li>When a unit is `with'ed, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
to the version of the unit most recently compiled into the library.

     <li>Inlining is effective only if the necessary body has already been
compiled into the library.

     <li>Compiling a unit may obsolete other units in the library. 
</ul>

<p>In GNAT, compiling one unit never affects the compilation of any other
units because the compiler reads only source files. Only changes to source
files can affect the results of a compilation. In particular:

     <ul>
<li>When a unit is `with'ed, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
to the source version of the unit that is currently accessible to the
compiler.

     <p><a name="index-Inlining-171"></a>
<li>Inlining requires the appropriate source files for the package or
subprogram bodies to be available to the compiler. Inlining is always
effective, independent of the order in which units are compiled.

     <li>Compiling a unit never affects any other compilations. The editing of
sources may cause previous compilations to be out of date if they
depended on the source file being modified. 
</ul>

<p>The most important result of these differences is that order of compilation
is never significant in GNAT. There is no situation in which one is
required to do one compilation before another. What shows up as order of
compilation requirements in the traditional Ada library becomes, in
GNAT, simple source dependencies; in other words, there is only a set
of rules saying what source files must be present when a file is
compiled.
