<h3 class="section">11.13 Other Elaboration Order Considerations</h3>

<p>This section has been entirely concerned with the issue of finding a valid
elaboration order, as defined by the Ada Reference Manual. In a case
where several elaboration orders are valid, the task is to find one
of the possible valid elaboration orders (and the static model in GNAT
will ensure that this is achieved).

<p>The purpose of the elaboration rules in the Ada Reference Manual is to
make sure that no entity is accessed before it has been elaborated. For
a subprogram, this means that the spec and body must have been elaborated
before the subprogram is called. For an object, this means that the object
must have been elaborated before its value is read or written. A violation
of either of these two requirements is an access before elaboration order,
and this section has been all about avoiding such errors.

<p>In the case where more than one order of elaboration is possible, in the
sense that access before elaboration errors are avoided, then any one of
the orders is 'correct' in the sense that it meets the requirements of
the Ada Reference Manual, and no such error occurs.

<p>However, it may be the case for a given program, that there are
constraints on the order of elaboration that come not from consideration
of avoiding elaboration errors, but rather from extra-lingual logic
requirements. Consider this example:

<pre class="example">    with Init_Constants;
    package Constants is
       X : Integer := 0;
       Y : Integer := 0;
    end Constants;
    
    package Init_Constants is
       procedure P; --* require a body*
    end Init_Constants;
    
    with Constants;
    package body Init_Constants is
       procedure P is begin null; end;
    begin
       Constants.X := 3;
       Constants.Y := 4;
    end Init_Constants;
    
    with Constants;
    package Calc is
       Z : Integer := Constants.X + Constants.Y;
    end Calc;
    
    with Calc;
    with Text_IO; use Text_IO;
    procedure Main is
    begin
       Put_Line (Calc.Z'Img);
    end Main;
</pre>
<p>In this example, there is more than one valid order of elaboration. For
example both the following are correct orders:

<pre class="example">    Init_Constants spec
    Constants spec
    Calc spec
    Init_Constants body
    Main body
</pre>
<p>and

<pre class="example">    Init_Constants spec
    Init_Constants body
    Constants spec
    Calc spec
    Main body
</pre>
<p>There is no language rule to prefer one or the other, both are correct
from an order of elaboration point of view. But the programmatic effects
of the two orders are very different. In the first, the elaboration routine
of <cite>Calc</cite> initializes <cite>Z</cite> to zero, and then the main program
runs with this value of zero. But in the second order, the elaboration
routine of <cite>Calc</cite> runs after the body of Init_Constants has set
<cite>X</cite> and <cite>Y</cite> and thus <cite>Z</cite> is set to 7 before <cite>Main</cite> runs.

<p>One could perhaps by applying pretty clever non-artificial intelligence
to the situation guess that it is more likely that the second order of
elaboration is the one desired, but there is no formal linguistic reason
to prefer one over the other. In fact in this particular case, GNAT will
prefer the second order, because of the rule that bodies are elaborated
as soon as possible, but it's just luck that this is what was wanted
(if indeed the second order was preferred).

<p>If the program cares about the order of elaboration routines in a case like
this, it is important to specify the order required. In this particular
case, that could have been achieved by adding to the spec of Calc:

<pre class="example">    pragma Elaborate_All (Constants);
</pre>
<p>which requires that the body (if any) and spec of <cite>Constants</cite>,
as well as the body and spec of any unit `with'ed by
<cite>Constants</cite> be elaborated before <cite>Calc</cite> is elaborated.

<p>Clearly no automatic method can always guess which alternative you require,
and if you are working with legacy code that had constraints of this kind
which were not properly specified by adding <cite>Elaborate</cite> or
<cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas, then indeed it is possible that two different
compilers can choose different orders.

<p>However, GNAT does attempt to diagnose the common situation where there
are uninitialized variables in the visible part of a package spec, and the
corresponding package body has an elaboration block that directly or
indirectly initialized one or more of these variables. This is the situation
in which a pragma Elaborate_Body is usually desirable, and GNAT will generate
a warning that suggests this addition if it detects this situation.

<p>The <cite>gnatbind</cite> `-p' switch may be useful in smoking
out problems. This switch causes bodies to be elaborated as late as possible
instead of as early as possible. In the example above, it would have forced
the choice of the first elaboration order. If you get different results
when using this switch, and particularly if one set of results is right,
and one is wrong as far as you are concerned, it shows that you have some
missing <cite>Elaborate</cite> pragmas. For the example above, we have the
following output:

<pre class="example">    $ gnatmake -f -q main
    $ main
     7
    $ gnatmake -f -q main -bargs -p
    $ main
     0
</pre>
<p>It is of course quite unlikely that both these results are correct, so
it is up to you in a case like this to investigate the source of the
difference, by looking at the two elaboration orders that are chosen,
and figuring out which is correct, and then adding the necessary
<cite>Elaborate</cite> or <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas to ensure the desired order.
