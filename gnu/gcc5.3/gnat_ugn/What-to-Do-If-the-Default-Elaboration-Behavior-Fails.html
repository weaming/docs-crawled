<h3 class="section">11.10 What to Do If the Default Elaboration Behavior Fails</h3>

<p>If the binder cannot find an acceptable order, it outputs detailed
diagnostics. For example:

<pre class="example">    error: elaboration circularity detected
    info:   "proc (body)" must be elaborated before "pack (body)"
    info:     reason: Elaborate_All probably needed in unit "pack (body)"
    info:     recompile "pack (body)" with -gnatel
    info:                             for full details
    info:       "proc (body)"
    info:         is needed by its spec:
    info:       "proc (spec)"
    info:         which is withed by:
    info:       "pack (body)"
    info:  "pack (body)" must be elaborated before "proc (body)"
    info:     reason: pragma Elaborate in unit "proc (body)"
</pre>
<p>In this case we have a cycle that the binder cannot break. On the one
hand, there is an explicit pragma Elaborate in <cite>proc</cite> for
<cite>pack</cite>. This means that the body of <cite>pack</cite> must be elaborated
before the body of <cite>proc</cite>. On the other hand, there is elaboration
code in <cite>pack</cite> that calls a subprogram in <cite>proc</cite>. This means
that for maximum safety, there should really be a pragma
Elaborate_All in <cite>pack</cite> for <cite>proc</cite> which would require that
the body of <cite>proc</cite> be elaborated before the body of
<cite>pack</cite>. Clearly both requirements cannot be satisfied. 
Faced with a circularity of this kind, you have three different options.

     <ul>
<li>`Fix the program'

     <p>The most desirable option from the point of view of long-term maintenance
is to rearrange the program so that the elaboration problems are avoided. 
One useful technique is to place the elaboration code into separate
child packages. Another is to move some of the initialization code to
explicitly called subprograms, where the program controls the order
of initialization explicitly. Although this is the most desirable option,
it may be impractical and involve too much modification, especially in
the case of complex legacy code.

     <li>`Perform dynamic checks'

     <p>If the compilations are done using the `-gnatE'
(dynamic elaboration check) switch, then GNAT behaves in a quite different
manner. Dynamic checks are generated for all calls that could possibly result
in raising an exception. With this switch, the compiler does not generate
implicit <cite>Elaborate</cite> or <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas. The behavior then is
exactly as specified in the <cite>Ada Reference Manual</cite>. 
The binder will generate
an executable program that may or may not raise <cite>Program_Error</cite>, and then
it is the programmer's job to ensure that it does not raise an exception. Note
that it is important to compile all units with the switch, it cannot be used
selectively.

     <li>`Suppress checks'

     <p>The drawback of dynamic checks is that they generate a
significant overhead at run time, both in space and time. If you
are absolutely sure that your program cannot raise any elaboration
exceptions, and you still want to use the dynamic elaboration model,
then you can use the configuration pragma
<cite>Suppress (Elaboration_Check)</cite> to suppress all such checks. For
example this pragma could be placed in the <code>gnat.adc</code> file.

     <li>`Suppress checks selectively'

     <p>When you know that certain calls or instantiations in elaboration code cannot
possibly lead to an elaboration error, and the binder nevertheless complains
about implicit <cite>Elaborate</cite> and <cite>Elaborate_All</cite> pragmas that lead to
elaboration circularities, it is possible to remove those warnings locally and
obtain a program that will bind. Clearly this can be unsafe, and it is the
responsibility of the programmer to make sure that the resulting program has no
elaboration anomalies. The pragma <cite>Suppress (Elaboration_Check)</cite> can be
used with different granularity to suppress warnings and break elaboration
circularities:

          <ul>
<li>Place the pragma that names the called subprogram in the declarative part
that contains the call.

          <li>Place the pragma in the declarative part, without naming an entity. This
disables warnings on all calls in the corresponding  declarative region.

          <li>Place the pragma in the package spec that declares the called subprogram,
and name the subprogram. This disables warnings on all elaboration calls to
that subprogram.

          <li>Place the pragma in the package spec that declares the called subprogram,
without naming any entity. This disables warnings on all elaboration calls to
all subprograms declared in this spec.

          <li>Use Pragma Elaborate.

          <p>As previously described in section <a href="2bd.html#g_t2bd">Treatment of Pragma Elaborate</a>,
GNAT in static mode assumes that a <cite>pragma</cite> Elaborate indicates correctly
that no elaboration checks are required on calls to the designated unit. 
There may be cases in which the caller knows that no transitive calls
can occur, so that a <cite>pragma Elaborate</cite> will be sufficient in a
case where <cite>pragma Elaborate_All</cite> would cause a circularity. 
</ul>

     <p>These five cases are listed in order of decreasing safety, and therefore
require increasing programmer care in their application. Consider the
following program:

     <pre class="example">         package Pack1 is
           function F1 return Integer;
           X1 : Integer;
         end Pack1;
         
         package Pack2 is
           function F2 return Integer;
           function Pure (x : integer) return integer;
           --  pragma Suppress (Elaboration_Check, On =&gt; Pure);  -- (3)
           --  pragma Suppress (Elaboration_Check);              -- (4)
         end Pack2;
         
         with Pack2;
         package body Pack1 is
           function F1 return Integer is
           begin
             return 100;
           end F1;
           Val : integer := Pack2.Pure (11);    --  Elab. call (1)
         begin
           declare
             --  pragma Suppress(Elaboration_Check, Pack2.F2);   -- (1)
             --  pragma Suppress(Elaboration_Check);             -- (2)
           begin
             X1 := Pack2.F2 + 1;                --  Elab. call (2)
           end;
         end Pack1;
         
         with Pack1;
         package body Pack2 is
           function F2 return Integer is
           begin
              return Pack1.F1;
           end F2;
           function Pure (x : integer) return integer is
           begin
              return x ** 3 - 3 * x;
           end;
         end Pack2;
         
         with Pack1, Ada.Text_IO;
         procedure Proc3 is
         begin
           Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(Pack1.X1'Img); -- 101
         end Proc3;
</pre>
     <p>In the absence of any pragmas, an attempt to bind this program produces
the following diagnostics:

     <pre class="example">         error: elaboration circularity detected
         info:    "pack1 (body)" must be elaborated before "pack1 (body)"
         info:       reason: Elaborate_All probably needed in unit "pack1 (body)"
         info:       recompile "pack1 (body)" with -gnatel for full details
         info:          "pack1 (body)"
         info:             must be elaborated along with its spec:
         info:          "pack1 (spec)"
         info:             which is withed by:
         info:          "pack2 (body)"
         info:             which must be elaborated along with its spec:
         info:          "pack2 (spec)"
         info:             which is withed by:
         info:          "pack1 (body)"
</pre>
     <p>The sources of the circularity are the two calls to <cite>Pack2.Pure</cite> and
<cite>Pack2.F2</cite> in the body of <cite>Pack1</cite>. We can see that the call to
F2 is safe, even though F2 calls F1, because the call appears after the
elaboration of the body of F1. Therefore the pragma (1) is safe, and will
remove the warning on the call. It is also possible to use pragma (2)
because there are no other potentially unsafe calls in the block.

     <p>The call to <cite>Pure</cite> is safe because this function does not depend on the
state of <cite>Pack2</cite>. Therefore any call to this function is safe, and it
is correct to place pragma (3) in the corresponding package spec.

     <p>Finally, we could place pragma (4) in the spec of <cite>Pack2</cite> to disable
warnings on all calls to functions declared therein. Note that this is not
necessarily safe, and requires more detailed examination of the subprogram
bodies involved. In particular, a call to <cite>F2</cite> requires that <cite>F1</cite>
be already elaborated. 
</ul>

<p>It is hard to generalize on which of these four approaches should be
taken. Obviously if it is possible to fix the program so that the default
treatment works, this is preferable, but this may not always be practical. 
It is certainly simple enough to use `-gnatE'
but the danger in this case is that, even if the GNAT binder
finds a correct elaboration order, it may not always do so,
and certainly a binder from another Ada compiler might not. A
combination of testing and analysis (for which the
information messages generated with the `-gnatel'
switch can be useful) must be used to ensure that the program is free
of errors. One switch that is useful in this testing is the
`-p (pessimistic elaboration order)' switch for <cite>gnatbind</cite>. 
Normally the binder tries to find an order that has the best chance
of avoiding elaboration problems. However, if this switch is used, the binder
plays a devil's advocate role, and tries to choose the order that
has the best chance of failing. If your program works even with this
switch, then it has a better chance of being error free, but this is still
not a guarantee.

<p>For an example of this approach in action, consider the C-tests (executable
tests) from the ACATS suite. If these are compiled and run with the default
treatment, then all but one of them succeed without generating any error
diagnostics from the binder. However, there is one test that fails, and
this is not surprising, because the whole point of this test is to ensure
that the compiler can handle cases where it is impossible to determine
a correct order statically, and it checks that an exception is indeed
raised at run time.

<p>This one test must be compiled and run using the `-gnatE'
switch, and then it passes. Alternatively, the entire suite can
be run using this switch. It is never wrong to run with the dynamic
elaboration switch if your code is correct, and we assume that the
C-tests are indeed correct (it is less efficient, but efficiency is
not a factor in running the ACATS tests.)
