<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Running <cite>gnatbind</cite></h4>

<p>The form of the <cite>gnatbind</cite> command is

<pre class="example">    $ gnatbind [`switches`] `mainprog`[.ali] [`switches`]
</pre>
<p>where <code>mainprog.adb</code> is the Ada file containing the main program
unit body. <cite>gnatbind</cite> constructs an Ada
package in two files whose names are
<code>b~mainprog.ads</code>, and <code>b~mainprog.adb</code>. 
For example, if given the
parameter <code>hello.ali</code>, for a main program contained in file
<code>hello.adb</code>, the binder output files would be <code>b~hello.ads</code>
and <code>b~hello.adb</code>.

<p>When doing consistency checking, the binder takes into consideration
any source files it can locate. For example, if the binder determines
that the given main program requires the package <cite>Pack</cite>, whose
<code>.ALI</code>
file is <code>pack.ali</code> and whose corresponding source spec file is
<code>pack.ads</code>, it attempts to locate the source file <code>pack.ads</code>
(using the same search path conventions as previously described for the
`gcc' command). If it can locate this source file, it checks that
the time stamps
or source checksums of the source and its references to in <code>ALI</code> files
match. In other words, any <code>ALI</code> files that mentions this spec must have
resulted from compiling this version of the source file (or in the case
where the source checksums match, a version close enough that the
difference does not matter).

<p><a name="index-Source-files-656"></a><a name="index-use-by-binder-657"></a>
The effect of this consistency checking, which includes source files, is
that the binder ensures that the program is consistent with the latest
version of the source files that can be located at bind time. Editing a
source file without compiling files that depend on the source file cause
error messages to be generated by the binder.

<p>For example, suppose you have a main program <code>hello.adb</code> and a
package <cite>P</cite>, from file <code>p.ads</code> and you perform the following
steps:

     <ul>
<li>Enter <cite>gcc -c hello.adb</cite> to compile the main program.

     <li>Enter <cite>gcc -c p.ads</cite> to compile package <cite>P</cite>.

     <li>Edit file <code>p.ads</code>.

     <li>Enter <cite>gnatbind hello</cite>. 
</ul>

<p>At this point, the file <code>p.ali</code> contains an out-of-date time stamp
because the file <code>p.ads</code> has been edited. The attempt at binding
fails, and the binder generates the following error messages:

<pre class="example">    error: "hello.adb" must be recompiled ("p.ads" has been modified)
    error: "p.ads" has been modified and must be recompiled
</pre>
<p>Now both files must be recompiled as indicated, and then the bind can
succeed, generating a main program. You need not normally be concerned
with the contents of this file, but for reference purposes a sample
binder output file is given in <a href="10.html#g_t10">Example of Binder Output File</a>.

<p>In most normal usage, the default mode of `gnatbind' which is to
generate the main package in Ada, as described in the previous section. 
In particular, this means that any Ada programmer can read and understand
the generated main program. It can also be debugged just like any other
Ada code provided the `-g' switch is used for
`gnatbind' and `gnatlink'.
