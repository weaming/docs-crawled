<h5 class="subsubsection">3.9.3.2 Building a Stand-alone Library</h5>

<p>GNAT's Project facility provides a simple way of building and installing
stand-alone libraries; see <a href="97.html#g_t97">Stand-alone Library Projects</a>. 
To be a Stand-alone Library Project, in addition to the two attributes
that make a project a Library Project (<cite>Library_Name</cite> and
<cite>Library_Dir</cite>; see <a href="8a.html#g_t8a">Library Projects</a>), the attribute
<cite>Library_Interface</cite> must be defined.  For example:

<pre class="example">    for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
    for Library_Name use "dummy";
    for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");
</pre>
<p>Attribute <cite>Library_Interface</cite> has a non-empty string list value,
each string in the list designating a unit contained in an immediate source
of the project file.

<p>When a Stand-alone Library is built, first the binder is invoked to build
a package whose name depends on the library name
(<code>b~dummy.ads/b</code> in the example above). 
This binder-generated package includes initialization and
finalization procedures whose
names depend on the library name (<cite>dummyinit</cite> and <cite>dummyfinal</cite>
in the example
above). The object corresponding to this package is included in the library.

<p>You must ensure timely (e.g., prior to any use of interfaces in the SAL)
calling of these procedures if a static SAL is built, or if a shared SAL
is built
with the project-level attribute <cite>Library_Auto_Init</cite> set to
<cite>"false"</cite>.

<p>For a Stand-Alone Library, only the <code>ALI</code> files of the Interface Units
(those that are listed in attribute <cite>Library_Interface</cite>) are copied to
the Library Directory. As a consequence, only the Interface Units may be
imported from Ada units outside of the library. If other units are imported,
the binding phase will fail.

<p>It is also possible to build an encapsulated library where not only
the code to elaborate and finalize the library is embedded but also
ensuring that the library is linked only against static
libraries. So an encapsulated library only depends on system
libraries, all other code, including the GNAT runtime, is embedded. To
build an encapsulated library the attribute
<cite>Library_Standalone</cite> must be set to <cite>encapsulated</cite>:

<pre class="example">    for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
    for Library_Name use "dummy";
    for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
    for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");
    for Library_Standalone use "encapsulated";
</pre>
<p>The default value for this attribute is <cite>standard</cite> in which case
a stand-alone library is built.

<p>The attribute <cite>Library_Src_Dir</cite> may be specified for a
Stand-Alone Library. <cite>Library_Src_Dir</cite> is a simple attribute that has a
single string value. Its value must be the path (absolute or relative to the
project directory) of an existing directory. This directory cannot be the
object directory or one of the source directories, but it can be the same as
the library directory. The sources of the Interface
Units of the library that are needed by an Ada client of the library will be
copied to the designated directory, called the Interface Copy directory. 
These sources include the specs of the Interface Units, but they may also
include bodies and subunits, when pragmas <cite>Inline</cite> or <cite>Inline_Always</cite>
are used, or when there is a generic unit in the spec. Before the sources
are copied to the Interface Copy directory, an attempt is made to delete all
files in the Interface Copy directory.

<p>Building stand-alone libraries by hand is somewhat tedious, but for those
occasions when it is necessary here are the steps that you need to perform:

     <ul>
<li>Compile all library sources.

     <li>Invoke the binder with the switch `-n' (No Ada main program),
with all the <code>ALI</code> files of the interfaces, and
with the switch `-L' to give specific names to the <cite>init</cite>
and <cite>final</cite> procedures.  For example:

     <pre class="example">         $ gnatbind -n int1.ali int2.ali -Lsal1
</pre>
     <li>Compile the binder generated file:

     <pre class="example">         $ gcc -c b~int2.adb
</pre>
     <li>Link the dynamic library with all the necessary object files,
indicating to the linker the names of the <cite>init</cite> (and possibly
<cite>final</cite>) procedures for automatic initialization (and finalization). 
The built library should be placed in a directory different from
the object directory.

     <li>Copy the <cite>ALI</cite> files of the interface to the library directory,
add in this copy an indication that it is an interface to a SAL
(i.e., add a word `SL' on the line in the <code>ALI</code> file that starts
with letter 'P') and make the modified copy of the <code>ALI</code> file
read-only. 
</ul>

<p>Using SALs is not different from using other libraries
(see <a href="8f.html#g_t8f">Using a library</a>).
