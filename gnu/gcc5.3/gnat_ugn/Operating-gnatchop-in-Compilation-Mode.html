<h5 class="subsubsection">3.3.6.2 Operating gnatchop in Compilation Mode</h5>

<p>The basic function of <cite>gnatchop</cite> is to take a file with multiple units
and split it into separate files. The boundary between files is reasonably
clear, except for the issue of comments and pragmas. In default mode, the
rule is that any pragmas between units belong to the previous unit, except
that configuration pragmas always belong to the following unit. Any comments
belong to the following unit. These rules
almost always result in the right choice of
the split point without needing to mark it explicitly and most users will
find this default to be what they want. In this default mode it is incorrect to
submit a file containing only configuration pragmas, or one that ends in
configuration pragmas, to <cite>gnatchop</cite>.

<p>However, using a special option to activate 'compilation mode',
<cite>gnatchop</cite>
can perform another function, which is to provide exactly the semantics
required by the RM for handling of configuration pragmas in a compilation. 
In the absence of configuration pragmas (at the main file level), this
option has no effect, but it causes such configuration pragmas to be handled
in a quite different manner.

<p>First, in compilation mode, if <cite>gnatchop</cite> is given a file that consists of
only configuration pragmas, then this file is appended to the
<code>gnat.adc</code> file in the current directory. This behavior provides
the required behavior described in the RM for the actions to be taken
on submitting such a file to the compiler, namely that these pragmas
should apply to all subsequent compilations in the same compilation
environment. Using GNAT, the current directory, possibly containing a
<code>gnat.adc</code> file is the representation
of a compilation environment. For more information on the
<code>gnat.adc</code> file, see <a href="58.html#g_t58">Handling of Configuration Pragmas</a>.

<p>Second, in compilation mode, if <cite>gnatchop</cite>
is given a file that starts with
configuration pragmas, and contains one or more units, then these
configuration pragmas are prepended to each of the chopped files. This
behavior provides the required behavior described in the RM for the
actions to be taken on compiling such a file, namely that the pragmas
apply to all units in the compilation, but not to subsequently compiled
units.

<p>Finally, if configuration pragmas appear between units, they are appended
to the previous unit. This results in the previous unit being illegal,
since the compiler does not accept configuration pragmas that follow
a unit. This provides the required RM behavior that forbids configuration
pragmas other than those preceding the first compilation unit of a
compilation.

<p>For most purposes, <cite>gnatchop</cite> will be used in default mode. The
compilation mode described above is used only if you need exactly
accurate behavior with respect to compilations, and you have files
that contain multiple units and configuration pragmas. In this
circumstance the use of <cite>gnatchop</cite> with the compilation mode
switch provides the required behavior, and is for example the mode
in which GNAT processes the ACVC tests.
