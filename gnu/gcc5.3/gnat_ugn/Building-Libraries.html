<h4 class="subsection">5.5.1 Building Libraries</h4>

<p>Let's enhance our example and transform the <cite>logging</cite> subsystem into a
library.  In order to do so, a few changes need to be made to
<code>logging.gpr</code>.  Some attributes need to be defined: at least
<cite>Library_Name</cite> and <cite>Library_Dir</cite>; in addition, some other attributes
can be used to specify specific aspects of the library. For readability, it is
also recommended (although not mandatory), to use the qualifier <cite>library</cite>
in front of the <cite>project</cite> keyword.

<p><a name="index-Library_005fName-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-831"></a>
`Library_Name':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute is the name of the library to be built. There is no
restriction on the name of a library imposed by the project manager, except
for stand-alone libraries whose names must follow the syntax of Ada
identifiers; however, there may be system-specific restrictions on the name. 
In general, it is recommended to stick to alphanumeric characters (and
possibly single underscores) to help portability. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-832"></a>
`Library_Dir':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute  is the path (absolute or relative) of the directory where
the library is to be installed. In the process of building a library,
the sources are compiled, the object files end up  in the explicit or
implicit <cite>Object_Dir</cite> directory. When all sources of a library
are compiled, some of the compilation artifacts, including the library itself,
are copied to the library_dir directory. This directory must exist and be
writable. It must also be different from the object directory so that cleanup
activities in the Library_Dir do not affect recompilation needs. 
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the new version of <code>logging.gpr</code> that makes it a library:

<pre class="example">    library project Logging is          --  "library" is optional
       for Library_Name use "logging";  --  will create "liblogging.a" on Unix
       for Object_Dir   use "obj";
       for Library_Dir  use "lib";      --  different from object_dir
    end Logging;
</pre>
<p>Once the above two attributes are defined, the library project is valid and
is enough for building a library with default characteristics. 
Other library-related attributes can be used to change the defaults:

<p><a name="index-Library_005fKind-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-833"></a>
`Library_Kind':

<blockquote>

<p>The value of this attribute must be either <cite>"static"</cite>, <cite>"dynamic"</cite> or
<cite>"relocatable"</cite> (the latter is a synonym for dynamic). It indicates
which kind of library should be built (the default is to build a
static library, that is an archive of object files that can potentially
be linked into a static executable). When the library is set to be dynamic,
a separate image is created that will be loaded independently, usually
at the start of the main program execution. Support for dynamic libraries is
very platform specific, for instance on Windows it takes the form of a DLL
while on GNU/Linux, it is a dynamic elf image whose suffix is usually
<code>.so</code>. Library project files, on the other hand, can be written in
a platform independent way so that the same project file can be used to build
a library on different operating systems.

<p>If you need to build both a static and a dynamic library, it is recommended
to use two different object directories, since in some cases some extra code
needs to be generated for the latter. For such cases, one can either define
two different project files, or a single one that uses scenarios to indicate
the various kinds of library to be built and their corresponding object_dir. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fALI_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-834"></a>
`Library_ALI_Dir':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute may be specified to indicate the directory where the ALI
files of the library are installed. By default, they are copied into the
<cite>Library_Dir</cite> directory, but as for the executables where we have a
separate <cite>Exec_Dir</cite> attribute, you might want to put them in a separate
directory since there can be hundreds of them. The same restrictions as for
the <cite>Library_Dir</cite> attribute apply. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fVersion-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-835"></a>
`Library_Version':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute is platform dependent, and has no effect on Windows. 
On Unix, it is used only for dynamic libraries as the internal
name of the library (the <cite>"soname"</cite>). If the library file name (built
from the <cite>Library_Name</cite>) is different from the <cite>Library_Version</cite>,
then the library file will be a symbolic link to the actual file whose name
will be <cite>Library_Version</cite>. This follows the usual installation schemes
for dynamic libraries on many Unix systems.

<pre class="example">    project Logging is
       Version := "1";
       for Library_Dir use "lib";
       for Library_Name use "logging";
       for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
       for Library_Version use "liblogging.so." &amp; Version;
    end Logging;
</pre>
<p>After the compilation, the directory <code>lib</code> will contain both a
<code>libdummy.so.1</code> library and a symbolic link to it called
<code>libdummy.so</code>. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fGCC-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-836"></a>
`Library_GCC':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute is the name of the tool to use instead of "gcc" to link shared
libraries. A common use of this attribute is to define a wrapper script that
accomplishes specific actions before calling gcc (which itself calls the
linker to build the library image). 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fOptions-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-837"></a>
`Library_Options':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute may be used to specify additional switches (last switches)
when linking a shared library.

<p>It may also be used to add foreign object files to a static library. 
Each string in Library_Options is an absolute or relative path of an object
file. When a relative path, it is relative to the object directory. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Leading_005fLibrary_005fOptions-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-838"></a>
`Leading_Library_Options':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute, that is taken into account only by `gprbuild', may be
used to specified leading options (first switches) when linking a shared
library. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Linker_005fOptions-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-839"></a>
`Linker.Linker_Options':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute specifies additional switches to be given to the linker when
linking an executable. It is ignored when defined in the main project and
taken into account in all other projects that are imported directly or
indirectly. These switches complement the <cite>Linker.Switches</cite>
defined in the main project. This is useful when a particular subsystem
depends on an external library: adding this dependency as a
<cite>Linker_Options</cite> in the project of the subsystem is more convenient than
adding it to all the <cite>Linker.Switches</cite> of the main projects that depend
upon this subsystem.
