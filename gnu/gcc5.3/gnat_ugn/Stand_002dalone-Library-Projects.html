<h4 class="subsection">5.5.3 Stand-alone Library Projects</h4>

<p><a name="index-standalone-libraries-_0028usage-with-GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-840"></a>
A `stand-alone library' is a library that contains the necessary code to
elaborate the Ada units that are included in the library. A stand-alone
library is a convenient way to add an Ada subsystem to a more global system
whose main is not in Ada since it makes the elaboration of the Ada part mostly
transparent. However, stand-alone libraries are also useful when the main is in
Ada: they provide a means for minimizing relinking &amp; redeployment of complex
systems when localized changes are made.

<p>The name of a stand-alone library, specified with attribute
<cite>Library_Name</cite>, must have the syntax of an Ada identifier.

<p>The most prominent characteristic of a stand-alone library is that it offers a
distinction between interface units and implementation units. Only the former
are visible to units outside the library. A stand-alone library project is thus
characterised by a third attribute, usually `Library_Interface', in addition
to the two attributes that make a project a Library Project
(<cite>Library_Name</cite> and <cite>Library_Dir</cite>). This third attribute may also be
`Interfaces'. `Library_Interface' only works when the interface is in Ada
and takes a list of units as parameter. `Interfaces' works for any supported
language and takes a list of sources as parameter.

<p><a name="index-Library_005fInterface-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-841"></a>
`Library_Interface':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute defines an explicit subset of the units of the project. Units
from projects importing this library project may only "with" units whose
sources are listed in the <cite>Library_Interface</cite>. Other sources are
considered implementation units.

<pre class="example">    for Library_Dir use "lib";
    for Library_Name use "logging";
    for Library_Interface use ("lib1", "lib2");  --  unit names
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>`Interfaces'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute defines an explicit subset of the source files of a project. 
Sources from projects importing this project, can only depend on sources from
this subset. This attribute can be used on non library projects. It can also
be used as a replacement for attribute <cite>Library_Interface</cite>, in which
case, units have to be replaced by source files. For multi-language library
projects, it is the only way to make the project a Stand-Alone Library project
whose interface is not purely Ada. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fStandalone-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-842"></a>
`Library_Standalone':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute defines the kind of standalone library to
build. Values are either <cite>standard</cite> (the default), <cite>no</cite> or
<cite>encapsulated</cite>. When <cite>standard</cite> is used the code to elaborate and
finalize the library is embedded, when <cite>encapsulated</cite> is used the
library can furthermore depend only on static libraries (including
the GNAT runtime). This attribute can be set to <cite>no</cite> to make it clear
that the library should not be standalone in which case the
<cite>Library_Interface</cite> should not defined. Note that this attribute
only applies to shared libraries, so <cite>Library_Kind</cite> must be set
to <cite>dynamic</cite>.

<pre class="example">    for Library_Dir use "lib";
    for Library_Name use "logging";
    for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
    for Library_Interface use ("lib1", "lib2");  --  unit names
    for Library_Standalone use "encapsulated";
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to include the elaboration code in the stand-alone library, the binder
is invoked on the closure of the library units creating a package whose name
depends on the library name (b~logging.ads/b in the example). 
This binder-generated package includes `initialization' and `finalization'
procedures whose names depend on the library name (<cite>logginginit</cite> and
<cite>loggingfinal</cite> in the example). The object corresponding to this package is
included in the library.

<p><a name="index-Library_005fAuto_005fInit-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-843"></a>
`Library_Auto_Init':

<blockquote>

<p>A dynamic stand-alone Library is automatically initialized
if automatic initialization of Stand-alone Libraries is supported on the
platform and if attribute `Library_Auto_Init' is not specified or
is specified with the value "true". A static Stand-alone Library is never
automatically initialized. Specifying "false" for this attribute
prevents automatic initialization.

<p>When a non-automatically initialized stand-alone library is used in an
executable, its initialization procedure must be called before any service of
the library is used. When the main subprogram is in Ada, it may mean that the
initialization procedure has to be called during elaboration of another
package. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-844"></a>
`Library_Dir':

<blockquote>

<p>For a stand-alone library, only the <code>ALI</code> files of the interface units
(those that are listed in attribute <cite>Library_Interface</cite>) are copied to
the library directory. As a consequence, only the interface units may be
imported from Ada units outside of the library. If other units are imported,
the binding phase will fail. 
</blockquote>

<p>`Binder.Default_Switches':

<blockquote>

<p>When a stand-alone library is bound, the switches that are specified in
the attribute `Binder.Default_Switches ("Ada")' are
used in the call to `gnatbind'. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fSrc_005fDir-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-845"></a>
`Library_Src_Dir':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute defines the location (absolute or relative to the project
directory) where the sources of the interface units are copied at
installation time. 
These sources includes the specs of the interface units along with the
closure of sources necessary to compile them successfully. That may include
bodies and subunits, when pragmas <cite>Inline</cite> are used, or when there are
generic units in specs. This directory cannot point to the object directory
or one of the source directories, but it can point to the library directory,
which is the default value for this attribute. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fSymbol_005fPolicy-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-846"></a>
`Library_Symbol_Policy':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute controls the export of symbols and, on some platforms (like
VMS) that have the notions of major and minor IDs built in the library
files, it controls the setting of these IDs. It is not supported on all
platforms (where it will just have no effect). It may have one of the
following values:

     <ul>
<li><cite>"autonomous"</cite> or <cite>"default"</cite>: exported symbols are not controlled

     <li><cite>"compliant"</cite>: if attribute `Library_Reference_Symbol_File'
is not defined, then it is equivalent to policy "autonomous". If there
are exported symbols in the reference symbol file that are not in the
object files of the interfaces, the major ID of the library is increased. 
If there are symbols in the object files of the interfaces that are not
in the reference symbol file, these symbols are put at the end of the list
in the newly created symbol file and the minor ID is increased.

     <li><cite>"controlled"</cite>: the attribute `Library_Reference_Symbol_File' must be
defined. The library will fail to build if the exported symbols in the
object files of the interfaces do not match exactly the symbol in the
symbol file.

     <li><cite>"restricted"</cite>: The attribute `Library_Symbol_File' must be defined. 
The library will fail to build if there are symbols in the symbol file that
are not in the exported symbols of the object files of the interfaces. 
Additional symbols in the object files are not added to the symbol file.

     <li><cite>"direct"</cite>: The attribute `Library_Symbol_File' must be defined and
must designate an existing file in the object directory. This symbol file
is passed directly to the underlying linker without any symbol processing. 
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fReference_005fSymbol_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-847"></a>
`Library_Reference_Symbol_File'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute may define the path name of a reference symbol file that is
read when the symbol policy is either "compliant" or "controlled", on
platforms that support symbol control, such as VMS, when building a
stand-alone library. The path may be an absolute path or a path relative
to the project directory. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Library_005fSymbol_005fFile-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-848"></a>
`Library_Symbol_File'

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute may define the name of the symbol file to be created when
building a stand-alone library when the symbol policy is either "compliant",
"controlled" or "restricted", on platforms that support symbol control,
such as VMS. When symbol policy is "direct", then a file with this name
must exist in the object directory.
