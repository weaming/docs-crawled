<h4 class="subsection">5.7.5 Syntax of aggregate projects</h4>

<p>An aggregate project follows the general syntax of project files. The
recommended extension is still <code>.gpr</code>. However, a special
<cite>aggregate</cite> qualifier must be put before the keyword
<cite>project</cite>.

<p>An aggregate project cannot `with' any other project (standard or
aggregate), except an abstract project which can be used to share attribute
values. Also, aggregate projects cannot be extended or imported though a
`with' clause by any other project. Building other aggregate projects from
an aggregate project is done through the Project_Files attribute (see below).

<p>An aggregate project does not have any source files directly (only
through other standard projects). Therefore a number of the standard
attributes and packages are forbidden in an aggregate project. Here is the
(non exhaustive) list:

     <ul>
<li>Languages

     <li>Source_Files, Source_List_File and other attributes dealing with
list of sources.

     <li>Source_Dirs, Exec_Dir and Object_Dir

     <li>Library_Dir, Library_Name and other library-related attributes

     <li>Main

     <li>Roots

     <li>Externally_Built

     <li>Inherit_Source_Path

     <li>Excluded_Source_Dirs

     <li>Locally_Removed_Files

     <li>Excluded_Source_Files

     <li>Excluded_Source_List_File

     <li>Interfaces
</ul>

<p>The only package that is authorized (albeit optional) is
Builder. Other packages (in particular Compiler, Binder and Linker)
are forbidden.

<p>The following three attributes can be used only in an aggregate project:

<p><a name="index-Project_005fFiles-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-852"></a>
`Project_Files':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute is compulsory (or else we are not aggregating any project,
and thus not doing anything). It specifies a list of <code>.gpr</code> files
that are grouped in the aggregate. The list may be empty. The project
files can be either other aggregate projects, or standard projects. When
grouping standard projects, you can have both the root of a project tree
(and you do not need to specify all its imported projects), and any project
within the tree.

<p>Basically, the idea is to specify all those projects that have
main programs you want to build and link, or libraries you want to
build. You can even specify projects that do not use the Main
attribute nor the <cite>Library_*</cite> attributes, and the result will be to
build all their source files (not just the ones needed by other
projects).

<p>The file can include paths (absolute or relative). Paths are relative to
the location of the aggregate project file itself (if you use a base name,
we expect to find the .gpr file in the same directory as the aggregate
project file). The environment variables <cite>ADA_PROJECT_PATH</cite>,
<cite>GPR_PROJECT_PATH</cite> and <cite>GPR_PROJECT_PATH_FILE</cite> are not used to find
the project files. The extension <code>.gpr</code> is mandatory, since this attribute
contains file names, not project names.

<p>Paths can also include the <cite>"*"</cite> and <cite>"**"</cite> globbing patterns. The
latter indicates that any subdirectory (recursively) will be
searched for matching files. The latter (<cite>"**"</cite>) can only occur at the
last position in the directory part (ie <cite>"a/**/*.gpr"</cite> is supported, but
not <cite>"**/a/*.gpr"</cite>). Starting the pattern with <cite>"**"</cite> is equivalent
to starting with <cite>"./**"</cite>.

<p>For now, the pattern <cite>"*"</cite> is only allowed in the filename part, not
in the directory part. This is mostly for efficiency reasons to limit the
number of system calls that are needed.

<p>Here are a few valid examples:

<pre class="example">    for Project_Files use ("a.gpr", "subdir/b.gpr");
    --  two specific projects relative to the directory of agg.gpr
    
    for Project_Files use ("/.gpr");
    --  all projects recursively
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-Project_005fPath-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-853"></a>
`Project_Path':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute can be used to specify a list of directories in
which to look for project files in `with' declarations.

<p>When you specify a project in Project_Files (say <cite>x/y/a.gpr</cite>), and
<cite>a.gpr</cite> imports a project <cite>b.gpr</cite>, only <cite>b.gpr</cite> is searched in
the project path. <cite>a.gpr</cite> must be exactly at
<cite>&lt;dir of the aggregate&gt;/x/y/a.gpr</cite>.

<p>This attribute, however, does not affect the search for the aggregated
project files specified with <cite>Project_Files</cite>.

<p>Each aggregate project has its own <cite>Project_Path</cite> (that is if
<cite>agg1.gpr</cite> includes <cite>agg2.gpr</cite>, they can potentially both have a
different <cite>Project_Path</cite>).

<p>This project path is defined as the concatenation, in that order, of:

     <ul>
<li>the current directory;

     <li>followed by the command line -aP switches;

     <li>then the directories from the GPR_PROJECT_PATH and ADA_PROJECT_PATH environment
variables;

     <li>then the directories from the Project_Path attribute;

     <li>and finally the predefined directories. 
</ul>

<p>In the example above, agg2.gpr's project path is not influenced by
the attribute agg1'Project_Path, nor is agg1 influenced by
agg2'Project_Path.

<p>This can potentially lead to errors. Consider the following example:

<pre class="example">    --
    --  +---------------+                  +----------------+
    --  | Agg1.gpr      |-=--includes--=--&gt;| Agg2.gpr       |
    --  |  'project_path|                  |  'project_path |
    --  |               |                  |                |
    --  +---------------+                  +----------------+
    --        :                                   :
    --        includes                        includes
    --        :                                   :
    --        v                                   v
    --    +-------+                          +---------+
    --    | P.gpr |&lt;---------- withs --------|  Q.gpr  |
    --    +-------+---------\                +---------+
    --        |             |
    --        withs         |
    --        |             |
    --        v             v
    --    +-------+      +---------+
    --    | R.gpr |      | R'.gpr  |
    --    +-------+      +---------+
</pre>
<p>When looking for p.gpr, both aggregates find the same physical file on
the disk. However, it might happen that with their different project
paths, both aggregate projects would in fact find a different r.gpr. 
Since we have a common project (p.gpr) "with"ing two different r.gpr,
this will be reported as an error by the builder.

<p>Directories are relative to the location of the aggregate project file.

<p>Example:

<pre class="example">    for Project_Path use ("/usr/local/gpr", "gpr/");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="index-External-_0028GNAT-Project-Manager_0029-854"></a>
`External':

<blockquote>

<p>This attribute can be used to set the value of environment
variables as retrieved through the <cite>external</cite> function
in projects. It does not affect the environment variables
themselves (so for instance you cannot use it to change the value
of your PATH as seen from the spawned compiler).

<p>This attribute affects the external values as seen in the rest of
the aggregate project, and in the aggregated projects.

<p>The exact value of external a variable comes from one of three
sources (each level overrides the previous levels):

     <ul>
<li>An External attribute in aggregate project, for instance
<cite>for External ("BUILD_MODE") use "DEBUG"</cite>;

     <li>Environment variables. 
These override the value given by the attribute, so that
users can override the value set in the (presumably shared
with others team members) aggregate project.

     <li>The -X command line switch to `gprbuild'. 
This always takes precedence. 
</ul>

<p>This attribute is only taken into account in the main aggregate
project (i.e. the one specified on the command line to `gprbuild'),
and ignored in other aggregate projects. It is invalid
in standard projects. 
The goal is to have a consistent value in all
projects that are built through the aggregate, which would not
be the case in the diamond case: A groups the aggregate
projects B and C, which both (either directly or indirectly)
build the project P. If B and C could set different values for
the environment variables, we would have two different views of
P, which in particular might impact the list of source files in P.
