<h4 class="subsection">15.2.2 Ensuring Compliance with the Real-Time Annex</h4>

<p><a name="index-Real_002dTime-Systems-Annex-compliance-929"></a>
Although mapping Ada tasks onto
the underlying threads has significant advantages, it does create some
complications when it comes to respecting the scheduling semantics
specified in the real-time annex (Annex D).

<p>For instance the Annex D requirement for the <cite>FIFO_Within_Priorities</cite>
scheduling policy states:

<blockquote>

<p>`When the active priority of a ready task that is not running
changes, or the setting of its base priority takes effect, the
task is removed from the ready queue for its old active priority
and is added at the tail of the ready queue for its new active
priority, except in the case where the active priority is lowered
due to the loss of inherited priority, in which case the task is
added at the head of the ready queue for its new active priority.' 
</blockquote>

<p>While most kernels do put tasks at the end of the priority queue when
a task changes its priority, (which respects the main
FIFO_Within_Priorities requirement), almost none keep a thread at the
beginning of its priority queue when its priority drops from the loss
of inherited priority.

<p>As a result most vendors have provided incomplete Annex D implementations.

<p>The GNAT run-time, has a nice cooperative solution to this problem
which ensures that accurate FIFO_Within_Priorities semantics are
respected.

<p>The principle is as follows.  When an Ada task T is about to start
running, it checks whether some other Ada task R with the same
priority as T has been suspended due to the loss of priority
inheritance.  If this is the case, T yields and is placed at the end of
its priority queue.  When R arrives at the front of the queue it
executes.

<p>Note that this simple scheme preserves the relative order of the tasks
that were ready to execute in the priority queue where R has been
placed at the end.
