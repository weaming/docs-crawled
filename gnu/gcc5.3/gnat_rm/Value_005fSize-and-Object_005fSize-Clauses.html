In Ada 95 and Ada 2005, <cite>T'Size</cite> for a type <cite>T</cite> is the minimum
number of bits required to hold values of type <cite>T</cite>. 
Although this interpretation was allowed in Ada 83, it was not required,
and this requirement in practice can cause some significant difficulties. 
For example, in most Ada 83 compilers, <cite>Natural'Size</cite> was 32. 
However, in Ada 95 and Ada 2005,
<cite>Natural'Size</cite> is
typically 31.  This means that code may change in behavior when moving
from Ada 83 to Ada 95 or Ada 2005.  For example, consider:

<pre class="example">    type Rec is record;
       A : Natural;
       B : Natural;
    end record;
    
    for Rec use record
       at 0  range 0 .. Natural'Size - 1;
       at 0  range Natural'Size .. 2 * Natural'Size - 1;
    end record;
</pre>
<p>In the above code, since the typical size of <cite>Natural</cite> objects
is 32 bits and <cite>Natural'Size</cite> is 31, the above code can cause
unexpected inefficient packing in Ada 95 and Ada 2005, and in general
there are cases where the fact that the object size can exceed the
size of the type causes surprises.

<p>To help get around this problem GNAT provides two implementation
defined attributes, <cite>Value_Size</cite> and <cite>Object_Size</cite>.  When
applied to a type, these attributes yield the size of the type
(corresponding to the RM defined size attribute), and the size of
objects of the type respectively.

<p>The <cite>Object_Size</cite> is used for determining the default size of
objects and components.  This size value can be referred to using the
<cite>Object_Size</cite> attribute.  The phrase 'is used' here means that it is
the basis of the determination of the size.  The backend is free to
pad this up if necessary for efficiency, e.g., an 8-bit stand-alone
character might be stored in 32 bits on a machine with no efficient
byte access instructions such as the Alpha.

<p>The default rules for the value of <cite>Object_Size</cite> for
discrete types are as follows:

     <ul>
<li>The <cite>Object_Size</cite> for base subtypes reflect the natural hardware
size in bits (run the compiler with `-gnatS' to find those values
for numeric types). Enumeration types and fixed-point base subtypes have
8, 16, 32 or 64 bits for this size, depending on the range of values
to be stored.

     <li>The <cite>Object_Size</cite> of a subtype is the same as the
<cite>Object_Size</cite> of
the type from which it is obtained.

     <li>The <cite>Object_Size</cite> of a derived base type is copied from the parent
base type, and the <cite>Object_Size</cite> of a derived first subtype is copied
from the parent first subtype. 
</ul>

<p>The <cite>Value_Size</cite> attribute
is the (minimum) number of bits required to store a value
of the type. 
This value is used to determine how tightly to pack
records or arrays with components of this type, and also affects
the semantics of unchecked conversion (unchecked conversions where
the <cite>Value_Size</cite> values differ generate a warning, and are potentially
target dependent).

<p>The default rules for the value of <cite>Value_Size</cite> are as follows:

     <ul>
<li>The <cite>Value_Size</cite> for a base subtype is the minimum number of bits
required to store all values of the type (including the sign bit
only if negative values are possible).

     <li>If a subtype statically matches the first subtype of a given type, then it has
by default the same <cite>Value_Size</cite> as the first subtype.  This is a
consequence of RM 13.1(14): "if two subtypes statically match,
then their subtype-specific aspects are the same".)

     <li>All other subtypes have a <cite>Value_Size</cite> corresponding to the minimum
number of bits required to store all values of the subtype.  For
dynamic bounds, it is assumed that the value can range down or up
to the corresponding bound of the ancestor
</ul>

<p>The RM defined attribute <cite>Size</cite> corresponds to the
<cite>Value_Size</cite> attribute.

<p>The <cite>Size</cite> attribute may be defined for a first-named subtype.  This sets
the <cite>Value_Size</cite> of
the first-named subtype to the given value, and the
<cite>Object_Size</cite> of this first-named subtype to the given value padded up
to an appropriate boundary.  It is a consequence of the default rules
above that this <cite>Object_Size</cite> will apply to all further subtypes.  On the
other hand, <cite>Value_Size</cite> is affected only for the first subtype, any
dynamic subtypes obtained from it directly, and any statically matching
subtypes.  The <cite>Value_Size</cite> of any other static subtypes is not affected.

<p><cite>Value_Size</cite> and
<cite>Object_Size</cite> may be explicitly set for any subtype using
an attribute definition clause.  Note that the use of these attributes
can cause the RM 13.1(14) rule to be violated.  If two access types
reference aliased objects whose subtypes have differing <cite>Object_Size</cite>
values as a result of explicit attribute definition clauses, then it
is illegal to convert from one access subtype to the other. For a more
complete description of this additional legality rule, see the
description of the <cite>Object_Size</cite> attribute.

<p>At the implementation level, Esize stores the Object_Size and the
RM_Size field stores the <cite>Value_Size</cite> (and hence the value of the
<cite>Size</cite> attribute,
which, as noted above, is equivalent to <cite>Value_Size</cite>).

<p>To get a feel for the difference, consider the following examples (note
that in each case the base is <cite>Short_Short_Integer</cite> with a size of 8):

<p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top">
Type or subtype declaration

<p></th><th valign="top">

<p>Object_Size

<p></th><th valign="top">

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>2

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p>4

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>16

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>3*

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">
<code>subtype x6 is x2'base range 0 .. dynamic;</code>

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>8

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>3*

<br></td></tr></table>

<p>Note: the entries marked '3*' are not actually specified by the Ada
Reference Manual, but it seems in the spirit of the RM rules to allocate
the minimum number of bits (here 3, given the range for <cite>x2</cite>)
known to be large enough to hold the given range of values.

<p>So far, so good, but GNAT has to obey the RM rules, so the question is
under what conditions must the RM <cite>Size</cite> be used. 
The following is a list
of the occasions on which the RM <cite>Size</cite> must be used:

     <ul>
<li>Component size for packed arrays or records

     <li>Value of the attribute <cite>Size</cite> for a type

     <li>Warning about sizes not matching for unchecked conversion
</ul>

<p>For record types, the <cite>Object_Size</cite> is always a multiple of the
alignment of the type (this is true for all types). In some cases the
<cite>Value_Size</cite> can be smaller. Consider:

<pre class="example">    type R is record
      X : Integer;
      Y : Character;
    end record;
</pre>
<p>On a typical 32-bit architecture, the X component will be four bytes, and
require four-byte alignment, and the Y component will be one byte. In this
case <cite>R'Value_Size</cite> will be 40 (bits) since this is the minimum size
required to store a value of this type, and for example, it is permissible
to have a component of type R in an outer array whose component size is
specified to be 48 bits. However, <cite>R'Object_Size</cite> will be 64 (bits),
since it must be rounded up so that this value is a multiple of the
alignment (4 bytes = 32 bits).

<p>For all other types, the <cite>Object_Size</cite>
and Value_Size are the same (and equivalent to the RM attribute <cite>Size</cite>). 
Only <cite>Size</cite> may be specified for such types.

<p>Note that <cite>Value_Size</cite> can be used to force biased representation
for a particular subtype. Consider this example:

<pre class="example">    type R is (A, B, C, D, E, F);
    subtype RAB is R range A .. B;
    subtype REF is R range E .. F;
</pre>
<p>By default, <cite>RAB</cite>
has a size of 1 (sufficient to accommodate the representation
of <cite>A</cite> and <cite>B</cite>, 0 and 1), and <cite>REF</cite>
has a size of 3 (sufficient to accommodate the representation
of <cite>E</cite> and <cite>F</cite>, 4 and 5). But if we add the
following <cite>Value_Size</cite> attribute definition clause:

<pre class="example">    for REF'Value_Size use 1;
</pre>
<p>then biased representation is forced for <cite>REF</cite>,
and 0 will represent <cite>E</cite> and 1 will represent <cite>F</cite>. 
A warning is issued when a <cite>Value_Size</cite> attribute
definition clause forces biased representation. This
warning can be turned off using <cite>-gnatw.B</cite>.
