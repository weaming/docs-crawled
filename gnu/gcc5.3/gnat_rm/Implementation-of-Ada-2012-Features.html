This chapter contains a complete list of Ada 2012 features that have been
implemented. 
Generally, these features are only
available if the `-gnat12' (Ada 2012 features enabled) option is set,
which is the default behavior,
or if the configuration pragma <cite>Ada_2012</cite> is used.

<p>However, new pragmas, attributes, and restrictions are
unconditionally available, since the Ada 95 standard allows the addition of
new pragmas, attributes, and restrictions (there are exceptions, which are
documented in the individual descriptions), and also certain packages
were made available in earlier versions of Ada.

<p>An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses on the description line. 
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases. A date of 0000-00-00 means that GNAT has always
implemented the feature, or implemented it as soon as it appeared as a
binding interpretation.

<p>Each feature corresponds to an Ada Issue ('AI') approved by the Ada
standardization group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG9) for inclusion in Ada 2012. 
The features are ordered based on the relevant sections of the Ada
Reference Manual ("RM").  When a given AI relates to multiple points
in the RM, the earliest is used.

<p>A complete description of the AIs may be found in
&lt;<code>http://www.ada-auth.org/ai05-summary.html</code>&gt;.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0176 Quantified expressions (2010-09-29)'

     <p>Both universally and existentially quantified expressions are implemented. 
They use the new syntax for iterators proposed in AI05-139-2, as well as
the standard Ada loop syntax.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0079 Allow other_format characters in source (2010-07-10)'

     <p>Wide characters in the unicode category `other_format' are now allowed in
source programs between tokens, but not within a token such as an identifier.

     <p>RM References:  2.01 (4/2)   2.02 (7)
</ul>

<p><a name="index-AI_002d0091-_0028Ada-2012-feature_0029-941"></a>

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0091 Do not allow other_format in identifiers (0000-00-00)'

     <p>Wide characters in the unicode category `other_format' are not permitted
within  an identifier, since this can be a security problem. The error
message for this case has been improved to be more specific, but GNAT has
never allowed such characters to appear in identifiers.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0100 Placement of pragmas  (2010-07-01)'

     <p>This AI is an earlier version of AI-163. It simplifies the rules
for legal placement of pragmas. In the case of lists that allow pragmas, if
the list may have no elements, then the list may consist solely of pragmas.

<li>`AI-0163 Pragmas in place of null (2010-07-01)'

     <p>A statement sequence may be composed entirely of pragmas. It is no longer
necessary to add a dummy <cite>null</cite> statement to make the sequence legal.

<li>`AI-0183 Aspect specifications (2010-08-16)'

     <p>Aspect specifications have been fully implemented except for pre and post-
conditions, and type invariants, which have their own separate AI's. All
forms of declarations listed in the AI are supported. The following is a
list of the aspects supported (with GNAT implementation aspects marked)

<p>Note that for aspects with an expression, e.g. <cite>Size</cite>, the expression is
treated like a default expression (visibility is analyzed at the point of
occurrence of the aspect, but evaluation of the expression occurs at the
freeze point of the entity involved).

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0128 Inequality is a primitive operation (0000-00-00)'

     <p>If an equality operator ("=") is declared for a type, then the implicitly
declared inequality operator ("/=") is a primitive operation of the type. 
This is the only reasonable interpretation, and is the one always implemented
by GNAT, but the RM was not entirely clear in making this point.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0003 Qualified expressions as names (2010-07-11)'

     <p>In Ada 2012, a qualified expression is considered to be syntactically a name,
meaning that constructs such as <cite>A'(F(X)).B</cite> are now legal. This is
useful in disambiguating some cases of overloading.

<li>`AI-0120 Constant instance of protected object (0000-00-00)'

     <p>This is an RM editorial change only. The section that lists objects that are
constant failed to include the current instance of a protected object
within a protected function. This has always been treated as a constant
in GNAT.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0008 General access to constrained objects (0000-00-00)'

     <p>The wording in the RM implied that if you have a general access to a
constrained object, it could be used to modify the discriminants. This was
obviously not intended. <cite>Constraint_Error</cite> should be raised, and GNAT
has always done so in this situation.

     <p>This is an editorial change only, to make more widespread use of the Ada 2012
'immutably limited'.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0096 Deriving from formal private types (2010-07-20)'

     <p>In general it is illegal for a type derived from a formal limited type to be
nonlimited.  This AI makes an exception to this rule: derivation is legal
if it appears in the private part of the generic, and the formal type is not
tagged. If the type is tagged, the legality check must be applied to the
private part of the package.

     <ul>
<li>`AI-0181 Soft hyphen is a non-graphic character (2010-07-23)'

     <p>From Ada 2005 on, soft hyphen is considered a non-graphic character, which
means that it has a special name (<cite>SOFT_HYPHEN</cite>) in conjunction with the
<cite>Image</cite> and <cite>Value</cite> attributes for the character types. Strictly
speaking this is an inconsistency with Ada 95, but in practice the use of
these attributes is so obscure that it will not cause problems.

<li>`AI-0182 Additional forms for `Character'Value' (0000-00-00)`

     <p>This AI allows <cite>Character'Value</cite> to accept the string <cite>'?'</cite> where
<cite>?</cite> is any character including non-graphic control characters. GNAT has
always accepted such strings. It also allows strings such as
<cite>HEX_00000041</cite> to be accepted, but GNAT does not take advantage of this
permission and raises <cite>Constraint_Error</cite>, as is certainly still
permitted.

<li>`AI-0214 Defaulted discriminants for limited tagged (2010-10-01)'

     <p>Ada 2012 relaxes the restriction that forbids discriminants of tagged types
to have default expressions by allowing them when the type is limited. It
is often useful to define a default value for a discriminant even though
it can't be changed by assignment.

<li>`AI-0102 Some implicit conversions are illegal (0000-00-00)'

     <p>It is illegal to assign an anonymous access constant to an anonymous access
variable. The RM did not have a clear rule to prevent this, but GNAT has
always generated an error for this usage.

<li>`AI-0158 Generalizing membership tests (2010-09-16)'

     <p>This AI extends the syntax of membership tests to simplify complex conditions
that can be expressed as membership in a subset of values of any type. It
introduces syntax for a list of expressions that may be used in loop contexts
as well.

explicit definition.

     <p>This AI clarifies dispatching rules, and simply confirms that dispatching
executes the operation of the parent type when there is no explicitly or
implicitly declared operation for the descendant type. This has always been
the case in all versions of GNAT.

     <p>The RM as written implied that in some cases it was possible to create an
object of an abstract type, by having an abstract extension inherit a non-
abstract constructor from its parent type. This mistake has been corrected

     <p>Equality of untagged record composes, so that the predefined equality for a
composite type that includes a component of some untagged record type
<cite>R</cite> uses the equality operation of <cite>R</cite> (which may be user-defined
or predefined). This makes the behavior of untagged records identical to that
of tagged types in this respect.

     <p>This change is an incompatibility with previous versions of Ada, but it
corrects a non-uniformity that was often a source of confusion. Analysis of
a large number of industrial programs indicates that in those rare cases
where a composite type had an untagged record component with a user-defined
equality, either there was no use of the composite equality, or else the code
expected the same composability as for tagged types, and thus had a bug that
would be fixed by this change.

<li>`AI-0002 Export C with unconstrained arrays (0000-00-00)'

     <p>The compiler is not required to support exporting an Ada subprogram with
convention C if there are parameters or a return type of an unconstrained
array type (such as <cite>String</cite>). GNAT allows such declarations but
generates warnings. It is possible, but complicated, to write the
corresponding C code and certainly such code would be specific to GNAT and
non-portable.

<li>`AI-0216 No_Task_Hierarchy forbids local tasks (0000-00-00)'

     <p>It is clearly the intention that <cite>No_Task_Hierarchy</cite> is intended to
forbid tasks declared locally within subprograms, or functions returning task
objects, and that is the implementation that GNAT has always provided. 
However the language in the RM was not sufficiently clear on this point. 
Thus this is a documentation change in the RM only.

<cite>Ada.Real_Time.Timing_Events.Set_Handler</cite>.

<li>`AI-0190 pragma Default_Storage_Pool (2010-09-15)'

     <p>This AI introduces a new pragma <cite>Default_Storage_Pool</cite>, which can be
used to control storage pools globally. 
In particular, you can force every access
type that is used for allocation (`new') to have an explicit storage pool,
or you can declare a pool globally to be used for all access types that lack
an explicit one.

<li>`AI-0189 No_Allocators_After_Elaboration (2010-01-23)'

     <p>This AI introduces a new restriction <cite>No_Allocators_After_Elaboration</cite>,
which says that no dynamic allocation will occur once elaboration is
completed. 
In general this requires a run-time check, which is not required, and which
GNAT does not attempt. But the static cases of allocators in a task body or
in the body of the main program are detected and flagged at compile or bind
time.

     <p>A new package <cite>System.Multiprocessors</cite> is added, together with the
definition of pragma <cite>CPU</cite> for controlling task affinity. A new no
dependence restriction, on <cite>System.Multiprocessors.Dispatching_Domains</cite>,
is added to the Ravenscar profile.
