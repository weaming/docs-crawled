<h3 class="section">4.48 Attribute Restriction_Set</h3>

<p><a name="index-Restriction_005fSet-238"></a>
<a name="index-Restrictions-239"></a>
This attribute allows compile time testing of restrictions that
are currently in effect. It is primarily intended for specializing
code in the run-time based on restrictions that are active (e.g. 
don't need to save fpt registers if restriction No_Floating_Point
is known to be in effect), but can be used anywhere.

<p>There are two forms:

<pre class="example">    System'Restriction_Set (partition_boolean_restriction_NAME)
    System'Restriction_Set (No_Dependence =&gt; library_unit_NAME);
</pre>
<p>In the case of the first form, the only restriction names
allowed are parameterless restrictions that are checked
for consistency at bind time. For a complete list see the
subtype <cite>System.Rident.Partition_Boolean_Restrictions</cite>.

<p>The result returned is True if the restriction is known to
be in effect, and False if the restriction is known not to
be in effect. An important guarantee is that the value of
a Restriction_Set attribute is known to be consistent throughout
all the code of a partition.

<p>This is trivially achieved if the entire partition is compiled
with a consistent set of restriction pragmas. However, the
compilation model does not require this. It is possible to
compile one set of units with one set of pragmas, and another
set of units with another set of pragmas. It is even possible
to compile a spec with one set of pragmas, and then WITH the
same spec with a different set of pragmas. Inconsistencies
in the actual use of the restriction are checked at bind time.

<p>In order to achieve the guarantee of consistency for the
Restriction_Set pragma, we consider that a use of the pragma
that yields False is equivalent to a violation of the
restriction.

<p>So for example if you write

<pre class="example">    if System'Restriction_Set (No_Floating_Point) then
       ...
    else
       ...
    end if;
</pre>
<p>And the result is False, so that the else branch is executed,
you can assume that this restriction is not set for any unit
in the partition. This is checked by considering this use of
the restriction pragma to be a violation of the restriction
No_Floating_Point. This means that no other unit can attempt
to set this restriction (if some unit does attempt to set it,
the binder will refuse to bind the partition).

<p>Technical note: The restriction name and the unit name are
intepreted entirely syntactically, as in the corresponding
Restrictions pragma, they are not analyzed semantically,
so they do not have a type.
