<h4 class="subsection">15.2.1 Mapping Ada Tasks onto the Underlying Kernel Threads</h4>

<p>GNAT's run-time support comprises two layers:

     <ul>
<li>GNARL (GNAT Run-time Layer)

     <li>GNULL (GNAT Low-level Library)
</ul>

<p>In GNAT, Ada's tasking services rely on a platform and OS independent
layer known as GNARL.  This code is responsible for implementing the
correct semantics of Ada's task creation, rendezvous, protected
operations etc.

<p>GNARL decomposes Ada's tasking semantics into simpler lower level
operations such as create a thread, set the priority of a thread,
yield, create a lock, lock/unlock, etc.  The spec for these low-level
operations constitutes GNULLI, the GNULL Interface.  This interface is
directly inspired from the POSIX real-time API.

<p>If the underlying executive or OS implements the POSIX standard
faithfully, the GNULL Interface maps as is to the services offered by
the underlying kernel.  Otherwise, some target dependent glue code maps
the services offered by the underlying kernel to the semantics expected
by GNARL.

<p>Whatever the underlying OS (VxWorks, UNIX, Windows, etc.) the
key point is that each Ada task is mapped on a thread in the underlying
kernel.  For example, in the case of VxWorks, one Ada task = one VxWorks task.

<p>In addition Ada task priorities map onto the underlying thread priorities. 
Mapping Ada tasks onto the underlying kernel threads has several advantages:

     <ul>
<li>The underlying scheduler is used to schedule the Ada tasks.  This
makes Ada tasks as efficient as kernel threads from a scheduling
standpoint.

     <li>Interaction with code written in C containing threads is eased
since at the lowest level Ada tasks and C threads map onto the same
underlying kernel concept.

     <li>When an Ada task is blocked during I/O the remaining Ada tasks are
able to proceed.

     <li>On multiprocessor systems Ada tasks can execute in parallel. 
</ul>

<p>Some threads libraries offer a mechanism to fork a new process, with the
child process duplicating the threads from the parent. 
GNAT does not
support this functionality when the parent contains more than one task.
