For record subtypes, GNAT permits the specification of the <cite>Bit_Order</cite>
attribute.  The specification may either correspond to the default bit
order for the target, in which case the specification has no effect and
places no additional restrictions, or it may be for the non-standard
setting (that is the opposite of the default).

<p>In the case where the non-standard value is specified, the effect is
to renumber bits within each byte, but the ordering of bytes is not
affected.  There are certain
restrictions placed on component clauses as follows:

     <ul>
<li>Components fitting within a single storage unit.

     <p>These are unrestricted, and the effect is merely to renumber bits.  For
example if we are on a little-endian machine with <cite>Low_Order_First</cite>
being the default, then the following two declarations have exactly
the same effect:

     <pre class="example">         type R1 is record
            A : Boolean;
            B : Integer range 1 .. 120;
         end record;
         
         for R1 use record
            A at 0 range 0 .. 0;
            B at 0 range 1 .. 7;
         end record;
         
         type R2 is record
            A : Boolean;
            B : Integer range 1 .. 120;
         end record;
         
         for R2'Bit_Order use High_Order_First;
         
         for R2 use record
            A at 0 range 7 .. 7;
            B at 0 range 0 .. 6;
         end record;
</pre>
     <p>The useful application here is to write the second declaration with the
<cite>Bit_Order</cite> attribute definition clause, and know that it will be treated
the same, regardless of whether the target is little-endian or big-endian.

     <li>Components occupying an integral number of bytes.

     <p>These are components that exactly fit in two or more bytes.  Such component
declarations are allowed, but have no effect, since it is important to realize
that the <cite>Bit_Order</cite> specification does not affect the ordering of bytes. 
In particular, the following attempt at getting an endian-independent integer
does not work:

     <pre class="example">         type R2 is record
            A : Integer;
         end record;
         
         for R2'Bit_Order use High_Order_First;
         
         for R2 use record
            A at 0 range 0 .. 31;
         end record;
</pre>
     <p>This declaration will result in a little-endian integer on a
little-endian machine, and a big-endian integer on a big-endian machine. 
If byte flipping is required for interoperability between big- and
little-endian machines, this must be explicitly programmed.  This capability
is not provided by <cite>Bit_Order</cite>.

     <li>Components that are positioned across byte boundaries

     <p>but do not occupy an integral number of bytes.  Given that bytes are not
reordered, such fields would occupy a non-contiguous sequence of bits
in memory, requiring non-trivial code to reassemble.  They are for this
reason not permitted, and any component clause specifying such a layout
will be flagged as illegal by GNAT. 
</ul>

<p>Since the misconception that Bit_Order automatically deals with all
endian-related incompatibilities is a common one, the specification of
a component field that is an integral number of bytes will always
generate a warning.  This warning may be suppressed using <cite>pragma Warnings (Off)</cite>
if desired.  The following section contains additional
details regarding the issue of byte ordering.
