<h3 class="section">2.80 Pragma Initialize_Scalars</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-with-Initialize_005fScalars-57"></a>
Syntax:

<pre class="example">    pragma Initialize_Scalars;
</pre>
<p>This pragma is similar to <cite>Normalize_Scalars</cite> conceptually but has
two important differences.  First, there is no requirement for the pragma
to be used uniformly in all units of a partition, in particular, it is fine
to use this just for some or all of the application units of a partition,
without needing to recompile the run-time library.

<p>In the case where some units are compiled with the pragma, and some without,
then a declaration of a variable where the type is defined in package
Standard or is locally declared will always be subject to initialization,
as will any declaration of a scalar variable.  For composite variables,
whether the variable is initialized may also depend on whether the package
in which the type of the variable is declared is compiled with the pragma.

<p>The other important difference is that you can control the value used
for initializing scalar objects.  At bind time, you can select several
options for initialization. You can
initialize with invalid values (similar to Normalize_Scalars, though for
Initialize_Scalars it is not always possible to determine the invalid
values in complex cases like signed component fields with non-standard
sizes). You can also initialize with high or
low values, or with a specified bit pattern.  See the GNAT
User's Guide for binder options for specifying these cases.

<p>This means that you can compile a program, and then without having to
recompile the program, you can run it with different values being used
for initializing otherwise uninitialized values, to test if your program
behavior depends on the choice.  Of course the behavior should not change,
and if it does, then most likely you have an incorrect reference to an
uninitialized value.

<p>It is even possible to change the value at execution time eliminating even
the need to rebind with a different switch using an environment variable. 
See the GNAT User's Guide for details.

<p>Note that pragma <cite>Initialize_Scalars</cite> is particularly useful in
conjunction with the enhanced validity checking that is now provided
in GNAT, which checks for invalid values under more conditions. 
Using this feature (see description of the `-gnatV' flag in the
GNAT User's Guide) in conjunction with
pragma <cite>Initialize_Scalars</cite>
provides a powerful new tool to assist in the detection of problems
caused by uninitialized variables.

<p>Note: the use of <cite>Initialize_Scalars</cite> has a fairly extensive
effect on the generated code. This may cause your code to be
substantially larger. It may also cause an increase in the amount
of stack required, so it is probably a good idea to turn on stack
checking (see description of stack checking in the GNAT
User's Guide) when using this pragma.
