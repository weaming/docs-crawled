<h3 class="section">15.1 Machine Code Insertions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Machine-Code-insertions-928"></a>
Package <cite>Machine_Code</cite> provides machine code support as described
in the Ada Reference Manual in two separate forms:

     <ul>
<li>Machine code statements, consisting of qualified expressions that
fit the requirements of RM section 13.8.

     <li>An intrinsic callable procedure, providing an alternative mechanism of
including machine instructions in a subprogram. 
</ul>

<p>The two features are similar, and both are closely related to the mechanism
provided by the asm instruction in the GNU C compiler.  Full understanding
and use of the facilities in this package requires understanding the asm
instruction, see the section on Extended Asm in
<cite>Using_the_GNU_Compiler_Collection_(GCC)</cite>.

<p>Calls to the function <cite>Asm</cite> and the procedure <cite>Asm</cite> have identical
semantic restrictions and effects as described below.  Both are provided so
that the procedure call can be used as a statement, and the function call
can be used to form a code_statement.

<p>Consider this C <cite>asm</cite> instruction:

<pre class="example">    asm ("fsinx %1 %0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</pre>
<p>The equivalent can be written for GNAT as:

<pre class="example">    Asm ("fsinx %1 %0",
         My_Float'Asm_Output ("=f", result),
         My_Float'Asm_Input  ("f",  angle));
</pre>
<p>The first argument to <cite>Asm</cite> is the assembler template, and is
identical to what is used in GNU C.  This string must be a static
expression.  The second argument is the output operand list.  It is
either a single <cite>Asm_Output</cite> attribute reference, or a list of such
references enclosed in parentheses (technically an array aggregate of
such references).

<p>The <cite>Asm_Output</cite> attribute denotes a function that takes two
parameters.  The first is a string, the second is the name of a variable
of the type designated by the attribute prefix.  The first (string)
argument is required to be a static expression and designates the
constraint (see the section on Constraints in
<cite>Using_the_GNU_Compiler_Collection_(GCC)</cite>)
for the parameter; e.g., what kind of register is required.  The second
argument is the variable to be written or updated with the
result.  The possible values for constraint are the same as those used in
the RTL, and are dependent on the configuration file used to build the
GCC back end.  If there are no output operands, then this argument may
either be omitted, or explicitly given as <cite>No_Output_Operands</cite>. 
No support is provided for GNU C's symbolic names for output parameters.

<p>The second argument of <code>my_float'Asm_Output</code> functions as
though it were an <cite>out</cite> parameter, which is a little curious, but
all names have the form of expressions, so there is no syntactic
irregularity, even though normally functions would not be permitted
<cite>out</cite> parameters.  The third argument is the list of input
operands.  It is either a single <cite>Asm_Input</cite> attribute reference, or
a list of such references enclosed in parentheses (technically an array
aggregate of such references).

<p>The <cite>Asm_Input</cite> attribute denotes a function that takes two
parameters.  The first is a string, the second is an expression of the
type designated by the prefix.  The first (string) argument is required
to be a static expression, and is the constraint for the parameter,
(e.g., what kind of register is required).  The second argument is the
value to be used as the input argument.  The possible values for the
constraint are the same as those used in the RTL, and are dependent on
the configuration file used to built the GCC back end. 
No support is provided for GNU C's symbolic names for input parameters.

<p>If there are no input operands, this argument may either be omitted, or
explicitly given as <cite>No_Input_Operands</cite>.  The fourth argument, not
present in the above example, is a list of register names, called the
`clobber' argument.  This argument, if given, must be a static string
expression, and is a space or comma separated list of names of registers
that must be considered destroyed as a result of the <cite>Asm</cite> call.  If
this argument is the null string (the default value), then the code
generator assumes that no additional registers are destroyed. 
In addition to registers, the special clobbers <cite>memory</cite> and
<cite>cc</cite> as described in the GNU C docs are both supported.

<p>The fifth argument, not present in the above example, called the
`volatile' argument, is by default <cite>False</cite>.  It can be set to
the literal value <cite>True</cite> to indicate to the code generator that all
optimizations with respect to the instruction specified should be
suppressed, and in particular an instruction that has outputs
will still be generated, even if none of the outputs are
used.  See <cite>Using_the_GNU_Compiler_Collection_(GCC)</cite>
for the full description. 
Generally it is strongly advisable to use Volatile for any ASM statement
that is missing either input or output operands or to avoid unwanted
optimizations. A warning is generated if this advice is not followed.

<p>No support is provided for GNU C's <cite>asm goto</cite> feature.

<p>The <cite>Asm</cite> subprograms may be used in two ways.  First the procedure
forms can be used anywhere a procedure call would be valid, and
correspond to what the RM calls 'intrinsic' routines.  Such calls can
be used to intersperse machine instructions with other Ada statements. 
Second, the function forms, which return a dummy value of the limited
private type <cite>Asm_Insn</cite>, can be used in code statements, and indeed
this is the only context where such calls are allowed.  Code statements
appear as aggregates of the form:

<pre class="example">    Asm_Insn'(Asm (...));
    Asm_Insn'(Asm_Volatile (...));
</pre>
<p>In accordance with RM rules, such code statements are allowed only
within subprograms whose entire body consists of such statements.  It is
not permissible to intermix such statements with other Ada statements.

<p>Typically the form using intrinsic procedure calls is more convenient
and more flexible.  The code statement form is provided to meet the RM
suggestion that such a facility should be made available.  The following
is the exact syntax of the call to <cite>Asm</cite>. As usual, if named notation
is used, the arguments may be given in arbitrary order, following the
normal rules for use of positional and named arguments:

<pre class="example">    ASM_CALL ::= Asm (
                     [Template =&gt;] static_string_EXPRESSION
                   [,[Outputs  =&gt;] OUTPUT_OPERAND_LIST      ]
                   [,[Inputs   =&gt;] INPUT_OPERAND_LIST       ]
                   [,[Clobber  =&gt;] static_string_EXPRESSION ]
                   [,[Volatile =&gt;] static_boolean_EXPRESSION] )
    
    OUTPUT_OPERAND_LIST ::=
      [PREFIX.]No_Output_Operands
    | OUTPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE
    | (OUTPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE {,OUTPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE})
    
    OUTPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE ::=
      SUBTYPE_MARK'Asm_Output (static_string_EXPRESSION, NAME)
    
    INPUT_OPERAND_LIST ::=
      [PREFIX.]No_Input_Operands
    | INPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE
    | (INPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE {,INPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE})
    
    INPUT_OPERAND_ATTRIBUTE ::=
      SUBTYPE_MARK'Asm_Input (static_string_EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION)
</pre>
<p>The identifiers <cite>No_Input_Operands</cite> and <cite>No_Output_Operands</cite>
are declared in the package <cite>Machine_Code</cite> and must be referenced
according to normal visibility rules. In particular if there is no
<cite>use</cite> clause for this package, then appropriate package name
qualification is required.
