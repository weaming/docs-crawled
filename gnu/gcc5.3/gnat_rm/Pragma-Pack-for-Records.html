<h3 class="section">9.11 Pragma Pack for Records</h3>

<p><a name="index-Pragma-Pack-_0028for-records_0029-508"></a>
Pragma <cite>Pack</cite> applied to a record will pack the components to reduce
wasted space from alignment gaps and by reducing the amount of space
taken by components.  We distinguish between `packable' components and
`non-packable' components. 
Components of the following types are considered packable:

     <ul>
<li>Components of a primitive type are packable unless they are aliased
or of an atomic type.

     <li>Small packed arrays, whose size does not exceed 64 bits, and where the
size is statically known at compile time, are represented internally
as modular integers, and so they are also packable. 
</ul>

<p>All packable components occupy the exact number of bits corresponding to
their <cite>Size</cite> value, and are packed with no padding bits, i.e., they
can start on an arbitrary bit boundary.

<p>All other types are non-packable, they occupy an integral number of
storage units, and
are placed at a boundary corresponding to their alignment requirements.

<p>For example, consider the record

<pre class="example">    type Rb1 is array (1 .. 13) of Boolean;
    pragma Pack (Rb1);
    
    type Rb2 is array (1 .. 65) of Boolean;
    pragma Pack (Rb2);
    
    type AF is new Float with Atomic;
    
    type X2 is record
       L1 : Boolean;
       L2 : Duration;
       L3 : AF;
       L4 : Boolean;
       L5 : Rb1;
       L6 : Rb2;
    end record;
    pragma Pack (X2);
</pre>
<p>The representation for the record X2 is as follows:

<pre class="example">    for X2'Size use 224;
    for X2 use record
       L1 at  0 range  0 .. 0;
       L2 at  0 range  1 .. 64;
       L3 at 12 range  0 .. 31;
       L4 at 16 range  0 .. 0;
       L5 at 16 range  1 .. 13;
       L6 at 18 range  0 .. 71;
    end record;
</pre>
<p>Studying this example, we see that the packable fields <cite>L1</cite>
and <cite>L2</cite> are
of length equal to their sizes, and placed at specific bit boundaries (and
not byte boundaries) to
eliminate padding.  But <cite>L3</cite> is of a non-packable float type (because
it is aliased), so it is on the next appropriate alignment boundary.

<p>The next two fields are fully packable, so <cite>L4</cite> and <cite>L5</cite> are
minimally packed with no gaps.  However, type <cite>Rb2</cite> is a packed
array that is longer than 64 bits, so it is itself non-packable.  Thus
the <cite>L6</cite> field is aligned to the next byte boundary, and takes an
integral number of bytes, i.e., 72 bits.
