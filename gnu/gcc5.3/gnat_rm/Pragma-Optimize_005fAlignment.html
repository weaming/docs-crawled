<h3 class="section">2.114 Pragma Optimize_Alignment</h3>

<p><a name="index-Alignment-59"></a><a name="index-default-settings-60"></a>
Syntax:

<pre class="example">    pragma Optimize_Alignment (TIME | SPACE | OFF);
</pre>
<p>This is a configuration pragma which affects the choice of default alignments
for types and objects where no alignment is explicitly specified. There is a
time/space trade-off in the selection of these values. Large alignments result
in more efficient code, at the expense of larger data space, since sizes have
to be increased to match these alignments. Smaller alignments save space, but
the access code is slower. The normal choice of default alignments for types
and individual alignment promotions for objects (which is what you get if you
do not use this pragma, or if you use an argument of OFF), tries to balance
these two requirements.

<p>Specifying SPACE causes smaller default alignments to be chosen in two cases. 
First any packed record is given an alignment of 1. Second, if a size is given
for the type, then the alignment is chosen to avoid increasing this size. For
example, consider:

<pre class="example">    type R is record
       X : Integer;
       Y : Character;
    end record;
    
    for R'Size use 5*8;
</pre>
<p>In the default mode, this type gets an alignment of 4, so that access to the
Integer field X are efficient. But this means that objects of the type end up
with a size of 8 bytes. This is a valid choice, since sizes of objects are
allowed to be bigger than the size of the type, but it can waste space if for
example fields of type R appear in an enclosing record. If the above type is
compiled in <cite>Optimize_Alignment (Space)</cite> mode, the alignment is set to 1.

<p>However, there is one case in which SPACE is ignored. If a variable length
record (that is a discriminated record with a component which is an array
whose length depends on a discriminant), has a pragma Pack, then it is not
in general possible to set the alignment of such a record to one, so the
pragma is ignored in this case (with a warning).

<p>Specifying SPACE also disables alignment promotions for standalone objects,
which occur when the compiler increases the alignment of a specific object
without changing the alignment of its type.

<p>Specifying TIME causes larger default alignments to be chosen in the case of
small types with sizes that are not a power of 2. For example, consider:

<pre class="example">    type R is record
       A : Character;
       B : Character;
       C : Boolean;
    end record;
    
    pragma Pack (R);
    for R'Size use 17;
</pre>
<p>The default alignment for this record is normally 1, but if this type is
compiled in <cite>Optimize_Alignment (Time)</cite> mode, then the alignment is set
to 4, which wastes space for objects of the type, since they are now 4 bytes
long, but results in more efficient access when the whole record is referenced.

<p>As noted above, this is a configuration pragma, and there is a requirement
that all units in a partition be compiled with a consistent setting of the
optimization setting. This would normally be achieved by use of a configuration
pragma file containing the appropriate setting. The exception to this rule is
that units with an explicit configuration pragma in the same file as the source
unit are excluded from the consistency check, as are all predefined units. The
latter are compiled by default in pragma Optimize_Alignment (Off) mode if no
pragma appears at the start of the file.
