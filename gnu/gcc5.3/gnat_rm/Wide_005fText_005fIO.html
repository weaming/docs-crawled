<h3 class="section">11.6 Wide_Text_IO</h3>

<p><cite>Wide_Text_IO</cite> is similar in most respects to Text_IO, except that
both input and output files may contain special sequences that represent
wide character values.  The encoding scheme for a given file may be
specified using a FORM parameter:

<pre class="example">    WCEM=`x`
</pre>
<p>as part of the FORM string (WCEM = wide character encoding method),
where <cite>x</cite> is one of the following characters

<p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top">
Character

<p></th><th valign="top">

<p>Encoding

<p><br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">
`h'

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>Hex ESC encoding

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>Upper half encoding

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p>Shift-JIS encoding

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">

<p>UTF-8 encoding

<p><br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top">
`b'

<p></td><td valign="top">

<p>Brackets encoding

<br></td></tr></table>

<p>The encoding methods match those that
can be used in a source
program, but there is no requirement that the encoding method used for
the source program be the same as the encoding method used for files,
and different files may use different encoding methods.

<p>The default encoding method for the standard files, and for opened files
for which no WCEM parameter is given in the FORM string matches the
wide character encoding specified for the main program (the default
being brackets encoding if no coding method was specified with -gnatW).

     <dl>
<dt>`Hex Coding'<dd>
In this encoding, a wide character is represented by a five character
sequence:
</dl>

<pre class="example">    ESC a b c d
</pre>
<blockquote>

<p>where <cite>a</cite>, <cite>b</cite>, <cite>c</cite>, <cite>d</cite> are the four hexadecimal
characters (using upper case letters) of the wide character code.  For
example, ESC A345 is used to represent the wide character with code
16#A345#.  This scheme is compatible with use of the full
<cite>Wide_Character</cite> set. 
</blockquote>

     <dl>
<dt>`Upper Half Coding'<dd>
The wide character with encoding 16#abcd#, where the upper bit is on
(i.e., a is in the range 8-F) is represented as two bytes 16#ab# and
16#cd#.  The second byte may never be a format control character, but is
not required to be in the upper half.  This method can be also used for
shift-JIS or EUC where the internal coding matches the external coding.

     <br><dt>`Shift JIS Coding'<dd>
A wide character is represented by a two character sequence 16#ab# and
16#cd#, with the restrictions described for upper half encoding as
described above.  The internal character code is the corresponding JIS
character according to the standard algorithm for Shift-JIS
conversion.  Only characters defined in the JIS code set table can be
used with this encoding method.

     <br><dt>`EUC Coding'<dd>
A wide character is represented by a two character sequence 16#ab# and
16#cd#, with both characters being in the upper half.  The internal
character code is the corresponding JIS character according to the EUC
encoding algorithm.  Only characters defined in the JIS code set table
can be used with this encoding method.

     <br><dt>`UTF-8 Coding'<dd>
A wide character is represented using
UCS Transformation Format 8 (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO
10646-1/Am.2.  Depending on the character value, the representation
is a one, two, or three byte sequence:
</dl>

<pre class="example">    16#0000#-16#007f#: 2#0xxxxxxx#
    16#0080#-16#07ff#: 2#110xxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#
    16#0800#-16#ffff#: 2#1110xxxx# 2#10xxxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#
</pre>
<blockquote>

<p>where the <cite>xxx</cite> bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
16-bit character value.  Note that all lower half ASCII characters
are represented as ASCII bytes and all upper half characters and
other wide characters are represented as sequences of upper-half
(The full UTF-8 scheme allows for encoding 31-bit characters as
6-byte sequences, but in this implementation, all UTF-8 sequences
of four or more bytes length will raise a Constraint_Error, as
will all invalid UTF-8 sequences.) 
</blockquote>

     <dl>
<dt>`Brackets Coding'<dd>
In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following eight
character sequence:
</dl>

<pre class="example">    [ " a b c d " ]
</pre>
<blockquote>

<p>where <cite>a</cite>, <cite>b</cite>, <cite>c</cite>, <cite>d</cite> are the four hexadecimal
characters (using uppercase letters) of the wide character code.  For
example, <cite>["A345"]</cite> is used to represent the wide character with code
<cite>16#A345#</cite>. 
This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set. 
On input, brackets coding can also be used for upper half characters,
e.g., <cite>["C1"]</cite> for lower case a.  However, on output, brackets notation
is only used for wide characters with a code greater than <cite>16#FF#</cite>.

<p>Note that brackets coding is not normally used in the context of
Wide_Text_IO or Wide_Wide_Text_IO, since it is really just designed as
a portable way of encoding source files. In the context of Wide_Text_IO
or Wide_Wide_Text_IO, it can only be used if the file does not contain
any instance of the left bracket character other than to encode wide
character values using the brackets encoding method. In practice it is
expected that some standard wide character encoding method such
as UTF-8 will be used for text input output.

<p>If brackets notation is used, then any occurrence of a left bracket
in the input file which is not the start of a valid wide character
sequence will cause Constraint_Error to be raised. It is possible to
encode a left bracket as ["5B"] and Wide_Text_IO and Wide_Wide_Text_IO
input will interpret this as a left bracket.

<p>However, when a left bracket is output, it will be output as a left bracket
and not as ["5B"]. We make this decision because for normal use of
Wide_Text_IO for outputting messages, it is unpleasant to clobber left
brackets. For example, if we write:

<pre class="example">    Put_Line ("Start of output [first run]");
</pre>
<p>we really do not want to have the left bracket in this message clobbered so
that the output reads:
</blockquote>

<pre class="example">    Start of output ["5B"]first run]
</pre>
<blockquote>

<p>In practice brackets encoding is reasonably useful for normal Put_Line use
since we won't get confused between left brackets and wide character
sequences in the output. But for input, or when files are written out
and read back in, it really makes better sense to use one of the standard
encoding methods such as UTF-8. 
</blockquote>

<p>For the coding schemes other than UTF-8, Hex, or Brackets encoding,
not all wide character
values can be represented.  An attempt to output a character that cannot
be represented using the encoding scheme for the file causes
Constraint_Error to be raised.  An invalid wide character sequence on
input also causes Constraint_Error to be raised.
