<h3 class="section">9.17 Effect of Convention on Representation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Convention-519"></a><a name="index-effect-on-representation-520"></a>
Normally the specification of a foreign language convention for a type or
an object has no effect on the chosen representation.  In particular, the
representation chosen for data in GNAT generally meets the standard system
conventions, and for example records are laid out in a manner that is
consistent with C.  This means that specifying convention C (for example)
has no effect.

<p>There are four exceptions to this general rule:

     <ul>
<li>`Convention Fortran and array subtypes'.

     <p>If pragma Convention Fortran is specified for an array subtype, then in
accordance with the implementation advice in section 3.6.2(11) of the
Ada Reference Manual, the array will be stored in a Fortran-compatible
column-major manner, instead of the normal default row-major order.

     <li>`Convention C and enumeration types'

     <p>GNAT normally stores enumeration types in 8, 16, or 32 bits as required
to accommodate all values of the type.  For example, for the enumeration
type declared by:

     <pre class="example">         type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
</pre>
     <p>8 bits is sufficient to store all values of the type, so by default, objects
of type <cite>Color</cite> will be represented using 8 bits.  However, normal C
convention is to use 32 bits for all enum values in C, since enum values
are essentially of type int.  If pragma <cite>Convention C</cite> is specified for an
Ada enumeration type, then the size is modified as necessary (usually to
32 bits) to be consistent with the C convention for enum values.

     <p>Note that this treatment applies only to types. If Convention C is given for
an enumeration object, where the enumeration type is not Convention C, then
Object_Size bits are allocated. For example, for a normal enumeration type,
with less than 256 elements, only 8 bits will be allocated for the object. 
Since this may be a surprise in terms of what C expects, GNAT will issue a
warning in this situation. The warning can be suppressed by giving an explicit
size clause specifying the desired size.

     <li>`Convention C/Fortran and Boolean types'

     <p>In C, the usual convention for boolean values, that is values used for
conditions, is that zero represents false, and nonzero values represent
true.  In Ada, the normal convention is that two specific values, typically
0/1, are used to represent false/true respectively.

     <p>Fortran has a similar convention for <cite>LOGICAL</cite> values (any nonzero
value represents true).

     <p>To accommodate the Fortran and C conventions, if a pragma Convention specifies
C or Fortran convention for a derived Boolean, as in the following example:

     <pre class="example">         type C_Switch is new Boolean;
         pragma Convention (C, C_Switch);
</pre>
     <p>then the GNAT generated code will treat any nonzero value as true.  For truth
values generated by GNAT, the conventional value 1 will be used for True, but
when one of these values is read, any nonzero value is treated as True. 
</ul>
