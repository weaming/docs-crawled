<h3 class="section">9.12 Record Representation Clauses</h3>

<p><a name="index-Record-Representation-Clause-509"></a>
Record representation clauses may be given for all record types, including
types obtained by record extension.  Component clauses are allowed for any
static component.  The restrictions on component clauses depend on the type
of the component.

<p><a name="index-Component-Clause-510"></a>
For all components of an elementary type, the only restriction on component
clauses is that the size must be at least the 'Size value of the type
(actually the Value_Size).  There are no restrictions due to alignment,
and such components may freely cross storage boundaries.

<p>Packed arrays with a size up to and including 64 bits are represented
internally using a modular type with the appropriate number of bits, and
thus the same lack of restriction applies.  For example, if you declare:

<pre class="example">    type R is array (1 .. 49) of Boolean;
    pragma Pack (R);
    for R'Size use 49;
</pre>
<p>then a component clause for a component of type R may start on any
specified bit boundary, and may specify a value of 49 bits or greater.

<p>For packed bit arrays that are longer than 64 bits, there are two
cases. If the component size is a power of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32 bits),
including the important case of single bits or boolean values, then
there are no limitations on placement of such components, and they
may start and end at arbitrary bit boundaries.

<p>If the component size is not a power of 2 (e.g., 3 or 5), then
an array of this type longer than 64 bits must always be placed on
on a storage unit (byte) boundary and occupy an integral number
of storage units (bytes). Any component clause that does not
meet this requirement will be rejected.

<p>Any aliased component, or component of an aliased type, must
have its normal alignment and size. A component clause that
does not meet this requirement will be rejected.

<p>The tag field of a tagged type always occupies an address sized field at
the start of the record.  No component clause may attempt to overlay this
tag. When a tagged type appears as a component, the tag field must have
proper alignment

<p>In the case of a record extension T1, of a type T, no component clause applied
to the type T1 can specify a storage location that would overlap the first
T'Size bytes of the record.

<p>For all other component types, including non-bit-packed arrays,
the component can be placed at an arbitrary bit boundary,
so for example, the following is permitted:

<pre class="example">    type R is array (1 .. 10) of Boolean;
    for R'Size use 80;
    
    type Q is record
       G, H : Boolean;
       L, M : R;
    end record;
    
    for Q use record
       G at 0 range  0 ..   0;
       H at 0 range  1 ..   1;
       L at 0 range  2 ..  81;
       R at 0 range 82 .. 161;
    end record;
</pre>
<p>Note: the above rules apply to recent releases of GNAT 5. 
In GNAT 3, there are more severe restrictions on larger components. 
For non-primitive types, including packed arrays with a size greater than
64 bits, component clauses must respect the alignment requirement of the
type, in particular, always starting on a byte boundary, and the length
must be a multiple of the storage unit.
