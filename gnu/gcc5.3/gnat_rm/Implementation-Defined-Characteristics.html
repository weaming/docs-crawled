<h2 class="chapter">7 Implementation Defined Characteristics</h2>

<p>In addition to the implementation dependent pragmas and attributes, and the
implementation advice, there are a number of other Ada features that are
potentially implementation dependent and are designated as
implementation-defined. These are mentioned throughout the Ada Reference
Manual, and are summarized in Annex M.

<p>A requirement for conforming Ada compilers is that they provide
documentation describing how the implementation deals with each of these
issues.  In this chapter you will find each point in Annex M listed,
followed by a description of how GNAT
handles the implementation dependence.

<p>You can use this chapter as a guide to minimizing implementation
dependent features in your programs if portability to other compilers
and other operating systems is an important consideration.  The numbers
in each entry below correspond to the paragraph numbers in the Ada
Reference Manual.

     <ul>
<li>"Whether or not each recommendation given in Implementation
Advice is followed.  See 1.1.2(37)." 
</ul>

<p>See <a href="a.html#a">Implementation Advice</a>.

     <ul>
<li>"Capacity limitations of the implementation.  See 1.1.3(3)." 
</ul>

<p>The complexity of programs that can be processed is limited only by the
total amount of available virtual memory, and disk space for the
generated object files.

     <ul>
<li>"Variations from the standard that are impractical to avoid
given the implementation's execution environment.  See 1.1.3(6)." 
</ul>

<p>There are no variations from the standard.

     <ul>
<li>"Which code_statements cause external
interactions.  See 1.1.3(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Any <cite>code_statement</cite> can potentially cause external interactions.

     <ul>
<li>"The coded representation for the text of an Ada
program.  See 2.1(4)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on source representation.

     <ul>
<li>"The control functions allowed in comments.  See 2.1(14)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on source representation.

     <ul>
<li>"The representation for an end of line.  See 2.2(2)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on source representation.

     <ul>
<li>"Maximum supported line length and lexical element
length.  See 2.2(15)." 
</ul>

<p>The maximum line length is 255 characters and the maximum length of
a lexical element is also 255 characters. This is the default setting
if not overridden by the use of compiler switch `-gnaty' (which
sets the maximum to 79) or `-gnatyMnn' which allows the maximum
line length to be specified to be any value up to 32767. The maximum
length of a lexical element is the same as the maximum line length.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation defined pragmas.  See 2.8(14)." 
</ul>

<p>See <a href="7.html#g_t7">Implementation Defined Pragmas</a>.

     <ul>
<li>"Effect of pragma <cite>Optimize</cite>.  See 2.8(27)." 
</ul>

<p>Pragma <cite>Optimize</cite>, if given with a <cite>Time</cite> or <cite>Space</cite>
parameter, checks that the optimization flag is set, and aborts if it is
not.

     <ul>
<li>"The sequence of characters of the value returned by
<code>S'Image</code> when some of the graphic characters of
<code>S'Wide_Image</code> are not defined in <cite>Character</cite>.  See
3.5(37)." 
</ul>

<p>The sequence of characters is as defined by the wide character encoding
method used for the source.  See section on source representation for
further details.

     <ul>
<li>"The predefined integer types declared in
<cite>Standard</cite>.  See 3.5.4(25)." 
</ul>

     <ul>
<li>"What combinations of small, range, and digits are
supported for fixed point types.  See 3.5.9(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Any combinations are permitted that do not result in a small less than
<cite>Fine_Delta</cite> and do not result in a mantissa larger than 63 bits. 
If the mantissa is larger than 53 bits on machines where Long_Long_Float
is 64 bits (true of all architectures except ia32), then the output from
Text_IO is accurate to only 53 bits, rather than the full mantissa.  This
is because floating-point conversions are used to convert fixed point.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of <cite>Tags.Expanded_Name</cite> for types declared
within an unnamed <cite>block_statement</cite>.  See 3.9(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Block numbers of the form <cite>B`nnn`</cite>, where <cite>nnn</cite> is a
decimal integer are allocated.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined attributes.  See 4.1.4(12)." 
</ul>

<p>See <a href="8.html#g_t8">Implementation Defined Attributes</a>.

     <ul>
<li>"Any implementation-defined time types.  See 9.6(6)." 
</ul>

<p>There are no implementation-defined time types.

     <ul>
<li>"The time base associated with relative delays." 
</ul>

<p>See 9.6(20).  The time base used is that provided by the C library
function <cite>gettimeofday</cite>.

     <ul>
<li>"The time base of the type <cite>Calendar.Time</cite>.  See
9.6(23)." 
</ul>

<p>The time base used is that provided by the C library function
<cite>gettimeofday</cite>.

     <ul>
<li>"The time zone used for package <cite>Calendar</cite>
operations.  See 9.6(24)." 
</ul>

<p>The time zone used by package <cite>Calendar</cite> is the current system time zone
setting for local time, as accessed by the C library function
<cite>localtime</cite>.

     <ul>
<li>"Any limit on <cite>delay_until_statements</cite> of
<cite>select_statements</cite>.  See 9.6(29)." 
</ul>

<p>There are no such limits.

     <ul>
<li>"Whether or not two non-overlapping parts of a composite
object are independently addressable, in the case where packing, record
layout, or <cite>Component_Size</cite> is specified for the object.  See
9.10(1)." 
</ul>

<p>Separate components are independently addressable if they do not share
overlapping storage units.

     <ul>
<li>"The representation for a compilation.  See 10.1(2)." 
</ul>

<p>A compilation is represented by a sequence of files presented to the
compiler in a single invocation of the `gcc' command.

     <ul>
<li>"Any restrictions on compilations that contain multiple
compilation_units.  See 10.1(4)." 
</ul>

<p>No single file can contain more than one compilation unit, but any
sequence of files can be presented to the compiler as a single
compilation.

     <ul>
<li>"The mechanisms for creating an environment and for adding
and replacing compilation units.  See 10.1.4(3)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on compilation model.

     <ul>
<li>"The manner of explicitly assigning library units to a
partition.  See 10.2(2)." 
</ul>

<p>If a unit contains an Ada main program, then the Ada units for the partition
are determined by recursive application of the rules in the Ada Reference
Manual section 10.2(2-6).  In other words, the Ada units will be those that
are needed by the main program, and then this definition of need is applied
recursively to those units, and the partition contains the transitive
closure determined by this relationship.  In short, all the necessary units
are included, with no need to explicitly specify the list.  If additional
units are required, e.g., by foreign language units, then all units must be
mentioned in the context clause of one of the needed Ada units.

<p>If the partition contains no main program, or if the main program is in
a language other than Ada, then GNAT
provides the binder options `-z' and `-n' respectively, and in
this case a list of units can be explicitly supplied to the binder for
inclusion in the partition (all units needed by these units will also
be included automatically).  For full details on the use of these
options, refer to the <cite>GNAT Make Program gnatmake</cite> in the
<cite>GNAT User's Guide</cite>.

     <ul>
<li>"The implementation-defined means, if any, of specifying
which compilation units are needed by a given compilation unit.  See
10.2(2)." 
</ul>

<p>The units needed by a given compilation unit are as defined in
the Ada Reference Manual section 10.2(2-6).  There are no
implementation-defined pragmas or other implementation-defined
means for specifying needed units.

     <ul>
<li>"The manner of designating the main subprogram of a
partition.  See 10.2(7)." 
</ul>

<p>The main program is designated by providing the name of the
corresponding <code>ALI</code> file as the input parameter to the binder.

     <ul>
<li>"The order of elaboration of <cite>library_items</cite>.  See
10.2(18)." 
</ul>

<p>The first constraint on ordering is that it meets the requirements of
Chapter 10 of the Ada Reference Manual.  This still leaves some
implementation dependent choices, which are resolved by first
elaborating bodies as early as possible (i.e., in preference to specs
where there is a choice), and second by evaluating the immediate with
clauses of a unit to determine the probably best choice, and
third by elaborating in alphabetical order of unit names
where a choice still remains.

     <ul>
<li>"Parameter passing and function return for the main
subprogram.  See 10.2(21)." 
</ul>

<p>The main program has no parameters.  It may be a procedure, or a function
returning an integer type.  In the latter case, the returned integer
value is the return code of the program (overriding any value that
may have been set by a call to <cite>Ada.Command_Line.Set_Exit_Status</cite>).

     <ul>
<li>"The mechanisms for building and running partitions.  See
10.2(24)." 
</ul>

<p>GNAT itself supports programs with only a single partition.  The GNATDIST
tool provided with the GLADE package (which also includes an implementation
of the PCS) provides a completely flexible method for building and running
programs consisting of multiple partitions.  See the separate GLADE manual
for details.

     <ul>
<li>"The details of program execution, including program
termination.  See 10.2(25)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on compilation model.

     <ul>
<li>"The semantics of any non-active partitions supported by the
implementation.  See 10.2(28)." 
</ul>

<p>Passive partitions are supported on targets where shared memory is
provided by the operating system.  See the GLADE reference manual for
further details.

     <ul>
<li>"The information returned by <cite>Exception_Message</cite>.  See
11.4.1(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Exception message returns the null string unless a specific message has
been passed by the program.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of <cite>Exceptions.Exception_Name</cite> for types
declared within an unnamed <cite>block_statement</cite>.  See 11.4.1(12)." 
</ul>

<p>Blocks have implementation defined names of the form <cite>B`nnn`</cite>
where <cite>nnn</cite> is an integer.

     <ul>
<li>"The information returned by
<cite>Exception_Information</cite>.  See 11.4.1(13)." 
</ul>

<p><cite>Exception_Information</cite> returns a string in the following format:

<pre class="example">    *Exception_Name:* nnnnn
    *Message:* mmmmm
    *PID:* ppp
    *Load address:* 0xhhhh
    *Call stack traceback locations:*
    0xhhhh 0xhhhh 0xhhhh ... 0xhhh
</pre>
<p>where

<blockquote>

     <ul>
<li><cite>nnnn</cite> is the fully qualified name of the exception in all upper
case letters. This line is always present.

     <li><cite>mmmm</cite> is the message (this line present only if message is non-null)

     <li><cite>ppp</cite> is the Process Id value as a decimal integer (this line is
present only if the Process Id is nonzero). Currently we are
not making use of this field.

     <li>The Load address line, the Call stack traceback locations line and the
following values are present only if at least one traceback location was
recorded. The Load address indicates the address at which the main executable
was loaded; this line may not be present if operating system hasn't relocated
the main executable. The values are given in C style format, with lower case
letters for a-f, and only as many digits present as are necessary. 
The line terminator sequence at the end of each line, including
the last line is a single <cite>LF</cite> character (<cite>16#0A#</cite>). 
</ul>
</blockquote>

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined check names.  See 11.5(27)." 
</ul>

<p>The implementation defined check name Alignment_Check controls checking of
address clause values for proper alignment (that is, the address supplied
must be consistent with the alignment of the type).

<p>The implementation defined check name Predicate_Check controls whether
predicate checks are generated.

<p>The implementation defined check name Validity_Check controls whether
validity checks are generated.

<p>In addition, a user program can add implementation-defined check names
by means of the pragma Check_Name.

     <ul>
<li>"The interpretation of each aspect of representation.  See
13.1(20)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on data representations.

     <ul>
<li>"Any restrictions placed upon representation items.  See
13.1(20)." 
</ul>

<p>See separate section on data representations.

     <ul>
<li>"The meaning of <cite>Size</cite> for indefinite subtypes.  See
13.3(48)." 
</ul>

<p>Size for an indefinite subtype is the maximum possible size, except that
for the case of a subprogram parameter, the size of the parameter object
is the actual size.

     <ul>
<li>"The default external representation for a type tag.  See
13.3(75)." 
</ul>

<p>The default external representation for a type tag is the fully expanded
name of the type in upper case letters.

     <ul>
<li>"What determines whether a compilation unit is the same in
two different partitions.  See 13.3(76)." 
</ul>

<p>A compilation unit is the same in two different partitions if and only
if it derives from the same source file.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined components.  See 13.5.1(15)." 
</ul>

<p>The only implementation defined component is the tag for a tagged type,
which contains a pointer to the dispatching table.

     <ul>
<li>"If <cite>Word_Size</cite> = <cite>Storage_Unit</cite>, the default bit
ordering.  See 13.5.3(5)." 
</ul>

<p><cite>Word_Size</cite> (32) is not the same as <cite>Storage_Unit</cite> (8) for this
implementation, so no non-default bit ordering is supported.  The default
bit ordering corresponds to the natural endianness of the target architecture.

     <ul>
<li>"The contents of the visible part of package <cite>System</cite>
and its language-defined children.  See 13.7(2)." 
</ul>

<p>See the definition of these packages in files <code>system.ads</code> and
<code>s-stoele.ads</code>. Note that two declarations are added to package
System.

<pre class="example">    Max_Priority           : constant Positive := Priority'Last;
    Max_Interrupt_Priority : constant Positive := Interrupt_Priority'Last;
</pre>
     <ul>
<li>"The contents of the visible part of package
<cite>System.Machine_Code</cite>, and the meaning of
<cite>code_statements</cite>.  See 13.8(7)." 
</ul>

<p>See the definition and documentation in file <code>s-maccod.ads</code>.

     <ul>
<li>"The effect of unchecked conversion.  See 13.9(11)." 
</ul>

<p>Unchecked conversion between types of the same size
results in an uninterpreted transmission of the bits from one type
to the other.  If the types are of unequal sizes, then in the case of
discrete types, a shorter source is first zero or sign extended as
necessary, and a shorter target is simply truncated on the left. 
For all non-discrete types, the source is first copied if necessary
to ensure that the alignment requirements of the target are met, then
a pointer is constructed to the source value, and the result is obtained
by dereferencing this pointer after converting it to be a pointer to the
target type. Unchecked conversions where the target subtype is an
unconstrained array are not permitted. If the target alignment is
greater than the source alignment, then a copy of the result is
made with appropriate alignment

     <ul>
<li>"The semantics of operations on invalid representations. 
See 13.9.2(10-11)." 
</ul>

<p>For assignments and other operations where the use of invalid values cannot
result in erroneous behavior, the compiler ignores the possibility of invalid
values. An exception is raised at the point where an invalid value would
result in erroneous behavior. For example executing:

<pre class="example">    procedure invalidvals is
      X : Integer := -1;
      Y : Natural range 1 .. 10;
      for Y'Address use X'Address;
      Z : Natural range 1 .. 10;
      A : array (Natural range 1 .. 10) of Integer;
    begin
      Z := Y;     -- no exception
      A (Z) := 3; -- exception raised;
    end;
</pre>
<p>As indicated, an exception is raised on the array assignment, but not
on the simple assignment of the invalid negative value from Y to Z.

     <ul>
<li>"The manner of choosing a storage pool for an access type
when <cite>Storage_Pool</cite> is not specified for the type.  See 13.11(17)." 
</ul>

<p>There are 3 different standard pools used by the compiler when
<cite>Storage_Pool</cite> is not specified depending whether the type is local
to a subprogram or defined at the library level and whether
<cite>Storage_Size`is specified or not. See documentation in the runtime library units `System.Pool_Global</cite>, <cite>System.Pool_Size</cite> and
<cite>System.Pool_Local</cite> in files <code>s-poosiz.ads</code>,
<code>s-pooglo.ads</code> and <code>s-pooloc.ads</code> for full details on the
default pools used.

     <ul>
<li>"Whether or not the implementation provides user-accessible
names for the standard pool type(s).  See 13.11(17)." 
</ul>

<p>See documentation in the sources of the run time mentioned in the previous
paragraph.  All these pools are accessible by means of <cite>with</cite>'ing
these units.

     <ul>
<li>"The meaning of <cite>Storage_Size</cite>.  See 13.11(18)." 
</ul>

<p><cite>Storage_Size</cite> is measured in storage units, and refers to the
total space available for an access type collection, or to the primary
stack space for a task.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined aspects of storage pools.  See
13.11(22)." 
</ul>

<p>See documentation in the sources of the run time mentioned in the
paragraph about standard storage pools above
for details on GNAT-defined aspects of storage pools.

     <ul>
<li>"The set of restrictions allowed in a pragma
<cite>Restrictions</cite>.  See 13.12(7)." 
</ul>

<p>See <a href="9.html#g_t9">Standard and Implementation Defined Restrictions</a>.

     <ul>
<li>"The consequences of violating limitations on
<cite>Restrictions</cite> pragmas.  See 13.12(9)." 
</ul>

<p>Restrictions that can be checked at compile time result in illegalities
if violated.  Currently there are no other consequences of violating
restrictions.

     <ul>
<li>"The representation used by the <cite>Read</cite> and
<cite>Write</cite> attributes of elementary types in terms of stream
elements.  See 13.13.2(9)." 
</ul>

<p>The representation is the in-memory representation of the base type of
the type, using the number of bits corresponding to the
<code>type'Size</code> value, and the natural ordering of the machine.

<li>"The names and characteristics of the numeric subtypes
declared in the visible part of package <cite>Standard</cite>.  See A.1(3)." 
</ul>

<p>See items describing the integer and floating-point types supported.

     <ul>
<li>"The string returned by <cite>Character_Set_Version</cite>. 
See A.3.5(3)." 
</ul>

<p><cite>Ada.Wide_Characters.Handling.Character_Set_Version</cite> returns
the string "Unicode 4.0", referring to version 4.0 of the
Unicode specification.

     <ul>
<li>"The accuracy actually achieved by the elementary
functions.  See A.5.1(1)." 
</ul>

<p>The elementary functions correspond to the functions available in the C
library.  Only fast math mode is implemented.

<li>"The sign of a zero result from some of the operators or
functions in <cite>Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions</cite>, when
<cite>Float_Type'Signed_Zeros</cite> is <cite>True</cite>.  See A.5.1(46)." 
</ul>

<p>The sign of zeroes follows the requirements of the IEEE 754 standard on
floating-point.

     <ul>
<li>"The value of
<cite>Numerics.Float_Random.Max_Image_Width</cite>.  See A.5.2(27)."

<p>Link names are the actual names used by the linker.

     <ul>
<li>"The manner of choosing link names when neither the link
name nor the address of an imported or exported entity is specified.  See
B.1(36)." 
</ul>

<p>The default linker name is that which would be assigned by the relevant

     <ul>
<li>"The effect of pragma <cite>Linker_Options</cite>.  See B.1(37)." 
</ul>

<p>The string passed to <cite>Linker_Options</cite> is presented uninterpreted as
an argument to the link command, unless it contains ASCII.NUL characters. 
NUL characters if they appear act as argument separators, so for example

<pre class="example">    pragma Linker_Options ("-labc" &amp; ASCII.NUL &amp; "-ldef");
</pre>
<p>causes two separate arguments <cite>-labc</cite> and <cite>-ldef</cite> to be passed to the
linker. The order of linker options is preserved for a given unit. The final
list of options passed to the linker is in reverse order of the elaboration
order. For example, linker options for a body always appear before the options
from the corresponding package spec.

<li>"The semantics of pragma <cite>Discard_Names</cite>.  See C.5(7)." 
</ul>

<p>Pragma <cite>Discard_Names</cite> causes names of enumeration literals to
be suppressed.  In the presence of this pragma, the Image attribute
provides the image of the Pos of the literal, and Value accepts
Pos values.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of the <cite>Task_Identification.Image</cite>
attribute.  See C.7.1(7)." 
</ul>

<p>The result of this attribute is a string that identifies
the object or component that denotes a given task. If a variable <cite>Var</cite>
has a task type, the image for this task will have the form <cite>Var_`XXXXXXXX`</cite>,
where the suffix
is the hexadecimal representation of the virtual address of the corresponding
task control block. If the variable is an array of tasks, the image of each
task will have the form of an indexed component indicating the position of a
given task in the array, e.g., <cite>Group(5)_`XXXXXXX`</cite>. If the task is a
component of a record, the image of the task will have the form of a selected
component. These rules are fully recursive, so that the image of a task that
is a subcomponent of a composite object corresponds to the expression that
designates this task.

<p>If a task is created by an allocator, its image depends on the context. If the
allocator is part of an object declaration, the rules described above are used
to construct its image, and this image is not affected by subsequent
assignments. If the allocator appears within an expression, the image
includes only the name of the task type.

<p>If the configuration pragma Discard_Names is present, or if the restriction
No_Implicit_Heap_Allocation is in effect,  the image reduces to
the numeric suffix, that is to say the hexadecimal representation of the
virtual address of the control block of the task.

     <ul>
<li>"The value of <cite>Current_Task</cite> when in a protected entry
or interrupt handler.  See C.7.1(17)." 
</ul>

<p>Protected entries or interrupt handlers can be executed by any
convenient thread, so the value of <cite>Current_Task</cite> is undefined.

     <ul>
<li>"The effect of calling <cite>Current_Task</cite> from an entry
body or interrupt handler.  See C.7.1(19)." 
</ul>

<p>The effect of calling <cite>Current_Task</cite> from an entry body or
interrupt handler is to return the identification of the task currently
executing the code.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined aspects of

     <ul>
<li>"Values of all <cite>Metrics</cite>.  See D(2)." 
</ul>

<p>The metrics information for GNAT depends on the performance of the
underlying operating system.  The sources of the run-time for tasking
implementation, together with the output from `-gnatG' can be
used to determine the exact sequence of operating systems calls made
to implement various tasking constructs.  Together with appropriate
information on the performance of the underlying operating system,
on the exact target in use, this information can be used to determine
the required metrics.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined <cite>policy_identifiers</cite> allowed
in a pragma <cite>Locking_Policy</cite>.  See D.3(4)." 
</ul>

<p>The two implementation defined policies permitted in GNAT are
<cite>Inheritance_Locking</cite> and  <cite>Conccurent_Readers_Locking</cite>.  On
targets that support the <cite>Inheritance_Locking</cite> policy, locking is
implemented by inheritance, i.e., the task owning the lock operates
at a priority equal to the highest priority of any task currently
requesting the lock.  On targets that support the
<cite>Conccurent_Readers_Locking</cite> policy, locking is implemented with a
read/write lock allowing multiple propected object functions to enter
concurrently.

conversion.  See G.2.1(10)." 
</ul>

<p>For cases where the result interval is implementation dependent, the
accuracy is that provided by performing all operations in 64-bit IEEE
floating-point format.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of a floating point arithmetic operation in
overflow situations, when the <cite>Machine_Overflows</cite> attribute of the
result type is <cite>False</cite>.  See G.2.1(13)." 
</ul>

<p>Infinite and NaN values are produced as dictated by the IEEE
floating-point standard. 
Note that on machines that are not fully compliant with the IEEE
floating-point standard, such as Alpha, the `-mieee' compiler flag
must be used for achieving IEEE conforming behavior (although at the cost
of a significant performance penalty), so infinite and NaN values are
properly generated.

     <ul>
<li>"The result interval for division (or exponentiation by a
negative exponent), when the floating point hardware implements division
as multiplication by a reciprocal.  See G.2.1(16)." 
</ul>

<p>Not relevant, division is IEEE exact.

     <ul>
<li>"The definition of close result set, which determines the
accuracy of certain fixed point multiplications and divisions.  See
G.2.3(5)." 
</ul>

<p>Operations in the close result set are performed using IEEE long format
floating-point arithmetic.  The input operands are converted to
floating-point, the operation is done in floating-point, and the result
is converted to the target type.

     <ul>
<li>"Conditions on a <cite>universal_real</cite> operand of a fixed
point multiplication or division for which the result shall be in the
perfect result set.  See G.2.3(22)." 
</ul>

<p>The result is only defined to be in the perfect result set if the result
can be computed by a single scaling operation involving a scale factor
representable in 64-bits.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of a fixed point arithmetic operation in
overflow situations, when the <cite>Machine_Overflows</cite> attribute of the
result type is <cite>False</cite>.  See G.2.3(27)." 
</ul>

<p>Not relevant, <cite>Machine_Overflows</cite> is <cite>True</cite> for fixed-point
types.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of an elementary function reference in
overflow situations, when the <cite>Machine_Overflows</cite> attribute of the
result type is <cite>False</cite>.  See G.2.4(4)." 
</ul>

<p>IEEE infinite and Nan values are produced as appropriate.

     <ul>
<li>"The value of the angle threshold, within which certain
elementary functions, complex arithmetic operations, and complex
elementary functions yield results conforming to a maximum relative
error bound.  See G.2.4(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Information on this subject is not yet available.

     <ul>
<li>"The accuracy of certain elementary functions for
parameters beyond the angle threshold.  See G.2.4(10)." 
</ul>

<p>Information on this subject is not yet available.

     <ul>
<li>"The result of a complex arithmetic operation or complex
elementary function reference in overflow situations, when the
<cite>Machine_Overflows</cite> attribute of the corresponding real type is
<cite>False</cite>.  See G.2.6(5)." 
</ul>

<p>IEEE infinite and Nan values are produced as appropriate.

     <ul>
<li>"The accuracy of certain complex arithmetic operations and
certain complex elementary functions for parameters (or components
thereof) beyond the angle threshold.  See G.2.6(8)." 
</ul>

<p>Information on those subjects is not yet available.

     <ul>
<li>"Information regarding bounded errors and erroneous
execution.  See H.2(1)." 
</ul>

<p>Information on this subject is not yet available.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined aspects of pragma
<cite>Inspection_Point</cite>.  See H.3.2(8)." 
</ul>

<p>Pragma <cite>Inspection_Point</cite> ensures that the variable is live and can
be examined by the debugger at the inspection point.

     <ul>
<li>"Implementation-defined aspects of pragma
<cite>Restrictions</cite>.  See H.4(25)." 
</ul>

<p>There are no implementation-defined aspects of pragma <cite>Restrictions</cite>.  The
use of pragma <cite>Restrictions [No_Exceptions]</cite> has no effect on the
generated code.  Checks must suppressed by use of pragma <cite>Suppress</cite>.

     <ul>
<li>"Any restrictions on pragma <cite>Restrictions</cite>.  See
H.4(27)." 
</ul>

<p>There are no restrictions on pragma <cite>Restrictions</cite>.
