<h3 class="section">9.1 Alignment Clauses</h3>

<p><a name="index-Alignment-Clause-479"></a>
GNAT requires that all alignment clauses specify a power of 2, and all
default alignments are always a power of 2.  The default alignment
values are as follows:

     <ul>
<li>`Primitive Types'.

     <p>For primitive types, the alignment is the minimum of the actual size of
objects of the type divided by <cite>Storage_Unit</cite>,
and the maximum alignment supported by the target. 
(This maximum alignment is given by the GNAT-specific attribute
<cite>Standard'Maximum_Alignment</cite>; see <a href="13e.html#g_t13e">Attribute Maximum_Alignment</a>.)

     <p><a name="index-Maximum_005fAlignment-attribute-480"></a>
For example, for type <cite>Long_Float</cite>, the object size is 8 bytes, and the
default alignment will be 8 on any target that supports alignments
this large, but on some targets, the maximum alignment may be smaller
than 8, in which case objects of type <cite>Long_Float</cite> will be maximally
aligned.

     <li>`Arrays'.

     <p>For arrays, the alignment is equal to the alignment of the component type
for the normal case where no packing or component size is given.  If the
array is packed, and the packing is effective (see separate section on
packed arrays), then the alignment will be one for long packed arrays,
or arrays whose length is not known at compile time.  For short packed
arrays, which are handled internally as modular types, the alignment
will be as described for primitive types, e.g., a packed array of length
31 bits will have an object size of four bytes, and an alignment of 4.

     <li>`Records'.

     <p>For the normal non-packed case, the alignment of a record is equal to
the maximum alignment of any of its components.  For tagged records, this
includes the implicit access type used for the tag.  If a pragma <cite>Pack</cite>
is used and all components are packable (see separate section on pragma
<cite>Pack</cite>), then the resulting alignment is 1, unless the layout of the
record makes it profitable to increase it.

     <p>A special case is when:

          <ul>
<li>the size of the record is given explicitly, or a
full record representation clause is given, and

          <li>the size of the record is 2, 4, or 8 bytes. 
</ul>

     <p>In this case, an alignment is chosen to match the
size of the record. For example, if we have:

     <pre class="example">         type Small is record
            A, B : Character;
         end record;
         for Small'Size use 16;
</pre>
     <p>then the default alignment of the record type <cite>Small</cite> is 2, not 1. This
leads to more efficient code when the record is treated as a unit, and also
allows the type to specified as <cite>Atomic</cite> on architectures requiring
strict alignment. 
</ul>

<p>An alignment clause may specify a larger alignment than the default value
up to some maximum value dependent on the target (obtainable by using the
attribute reference <cite>Standard'Maximum_Alignment</cite>). It may also specify
a smaller alignment than the default value for enumeration, integer and
fixed point types, as well as for record types, for example

<pre class="example">    type V is record
       A : Integer;
    end record;
    
    for V'alignment use 1;
</pre>
<p><a name="index-Alignment-481"></a><a name="index-default-482"></a>
The default alignment for the type <cite>V</cite> is 4, as a result of the
Integer field in the record, but it is permissible, as shown, to
override the default alignment of the record with a smaller value.

<p><a name="index-Alignment-483"></a><a name="index-subtypes-484"></a>
Note that according to the Ada standard, an alignment clause applies only
to the first named subtype. If additional subtypes are declared, then the
compiler is allowed to choose any alignment it likes, and there is no way
to control this choice. Consider:

<pre class="example">    type R is range 1 .. 10_000;
    for R'Alignment use 1;
    subtype RS is R range 1 .. 1000;
</pre>
<p>The alignment clause specifies an alignment of 1 for the first named subtype
<cite>R</cite> but this does not necessarily apply to <cite>RS</cite>. When writing
portable Ada code, you should avoid writing code that explicitly or
implicitly relies on the alignment of such subtypes.

<p>For the GNAT compiler, if an explicit alignment clause is given, this
value is also used for any subsequent subtypes. So for GNAT, in the
above example, you can count on the alignment of <cite>RS</cite> being 1. But this
assumption is non-portable, and other compilers may choose different
alignments for the subtype <cite>RS</cite>.
