<h3 class="section">3.1 C Type Interoperability</h3>

<p>Basic types map directly: an <code>int</code> in Go is an <code>int</code> in C,
etc.  Go <code>byte</code> is equivalent to C <code>unsigned char</code>. 
Pointers in Go are pointers in C.  A Go <code>struct</code> is the same as C
<code>struct</code> with the same field names and types.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstring_007d-in-C-15"></a>The Go <code>string</code> type is currently defined as a two-element
structure:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct __go_string {
       const unsigned char *__data;
       int __length;
     };
</pre>
   <p>You can't pass arrays between C and Go.  However, a pointer to an
array in Go is equivalent to a C pointer to the equivalent of the
element type.  For example, Go <code>*[10]int</code> is equivalent to C
<code>int*</code>, assuming that the C pointer does point to 10 elements.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bslice_007d-in-C-16"></a>A slice in Go is a structure.  The current definition is:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct __go_slice {
       void *__values;
       int __count;
       int __capacity;
     };
</pre>
   <p>The type of a Go function with no receiver is equivalent to a C
function whose parameter types are equivalent.  When a Go function
returns more than one value, the C function returns a struct.  For
example, these functions have equivalent types:

<pre class="smallexample">     func GoFunction(int) (int, float)
     struct { int i; float f; } CFunction(int)
</pre>
   <p>A pointer to a Go function is equivalent to a pointer to a C function
when the functions have equivalent types.

   <p>Go <code>interface</code>, <code>channel</code>, and <code>map</code> types have no
corresponding C type (<code>interface</code> is a two-element struct and
<code>channel</code> and <code>map</code> are pointers to structs in C, but the
structs are deliberately undocumented).  C <code>enum</code> types
correspond to some integer type, but precisely which one is difficult
to predict in general; use a cast.  C <code>union</code> types have no
corresponding Go type.  C <code>struct</code> types containing bitfields
have no corresponding Go type.  C++ <code>class</code> types have no
corresponding Go type.

   <p>Memory allocation is completely different between C and Go, as Go uses
garbage collection.  The exact guidelines in this area are
undetermined, but it is likely that it will be permitted to pass a
pointer to allocated memory from C to Go.  The responsibility of
eventually freeing the pointer will remain with C side, and of course
if the C side frees the pointer while the Go side still has a copy the
program will fail.  When passing a pointer from Go to C, the Go
function must retain a visible copy of it in some Go variable. 
Otherwise the Go garbage collector may delete the pointer while the C
function is still using it.
