<h2 class="chapter">7 Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p><a name="index-Bugs_002c-reporting-227"></a>Email bug reports to <a href="mailto:bonzini@gnu.org">bonzini@gnu.org</a>. 
Be sure to include the word &ldquo;sed&rdquo; somewhere in the <code>Subject:</code> field. 
Also, please include the output of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sed --version</span></samp>&rsquo; in the body
of your report if at all possible.

   <p>Please do not send a bug report like this:

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">while building frobme-1.3.4</span>
     $ configure
     error--&gt; sed: file sedscr line 1: Unknown option to 's'
</pre>
   <p>If <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> doesn't configure your favorite package, take a
few extra minutes to identify the specific problem and make a stand-alone
test case.  Unlike other programs such as C compilers, making such test
cases for <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> is quite simple.

   <p>A stand-alone test case includes all the data necessary to perform the
test, and the specific invocation of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> that causes the problem. 
The smaller a stand-alone test case is, the better.  A test case should
not involve something as far removed from <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> as &ldquo;try to configure
frobme-1.3.4&rdquo;.  Yes, that is in principle enough information to look
for the bug, but that is not a very practical prospect.

   <p>Here are a few commonly reported bugs that are not bugs.

     <dl>
<dt><code>N</code> command on the last line<dd><a name="index-Portability_002c-_0040code_007bN_007d-command-on-the-last-line-228"></a><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-_0040code_007bN_007d-command-on-the-last-line-229"></a>
Most versions of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> exit without printing anything when
the <samp><span class="command">N</span></samp> command is issued on the last line of a file. 
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> prints pattern space before exiting unless of course
the <samp><span class="command">-n</span></samp> command switch has been specified.  This choice is
by design.

     <p>For example, the behavior of
     <pre class="example">          sed N foo bar
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">would depend on whether foo has an even or an odd number of
lines<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Or, when writing a script to read the
next few lines following a pattern match, traditional
implementations of <code>sed</code> would force you to write
something like
     <pre class="example">          /foo/{ $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">instead of just
     <pre class="example">          /foo/{ N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N; }
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bPOSIXLY_005fCORRECT_007d-behavior_002c-_0040code_007bN_007d-command-230"></a>In any case, the simplest workaround is to use <code>$d;N</code> in
scripts that rely on the traditional behavior, or to set
the <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code> variable to a non-empty value.

     <br><dt>Regex syntax clashes (problems with backslashes)<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bGNU_007d-extensions_002c-to-basic-regular-expressions-231"></a><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-regex-syntax-clashes-232"></a><samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> uses the <span class="sc">posix</span> basic regular expression syntax.  According to
the standard, the meaning of some escape sequences is undefined in
this syntax;  notable in the case of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> are <code>\|</code>,
<code>\+</code>, <code>\?</code>, <code>\`</code>, <code>\'</code>, <code>\&lt;</code>,
<code>\&gt;</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\B</code>, <code>\w</code>, and <code>\W</code>.

     <p>As in all <acronym>GNU</acronym> programs that use <span class="sc">posix</span> basic regular
expressions, <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> interprets these escape sequences as special
characters.  So, <code>x\+</code> matches one or more occurrences of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<code>abc\|def</code> matches either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abc</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">def</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>This syntax may cause problems when running scripts written for other
<samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>s.  Some <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> programs have been written with the
assumption that <code>\|</code> and <code>\+</code> match the literal characters
<code>|</code> and <code>+</code>.  Such scripts must be modified by removing the
spurious backslashes if they are to be used with modern implementations
of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>, like
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>.

     <p>On the other hand, some scripts use s|abc\|def||g to remove occurrences
of <em>either</em> <code>abc</code> or <code>def</code>.  While this worked until
<samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> 4.0.x, newer versions interpret this as removing the
string <code>abc|def</code>.  This is again undefined behavior according to
<acronym>POSIX</acronym>, and this interpretation is arguably more robust: older
<samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>s, for example, required that the regex matcher parsed
<code>\/</code> as <code>/</code> in the common case of escaping a slash, which is
again undefined behavior; the new behavior avoids this, and this is good
because the regex matcher is only partially under our control.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bGNU_007d-extensions_002c-special-escapes-233"></a>In addition, this version of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> supports several escape characters
(some of which are multi-character) to insert non-printable characters
in scripts (<code>\a</code>, <code>\c</code>, <code>\d</code>, <code>\o</code>, <code>\r</code>,
<code>\t</code>, <code>\v</code>, <code>\x</code>).  These can cause similar problems
with scripts written for other <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>s.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> clobbers read-only files<dd><a name="index-In_002dplace-editing-234"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bSSEDEXT_007d_002c-in_002dplace-editing-235"></a><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-in_002dplace-editing-236"></a>
In short, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sed -i</span></samp>&rsquo; will let you delete the contents of
a read-only file, and in general the <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> option
(see <a href="Invoking-sed.html#Invoking-sed">Invocation</a>) lets you clobber
protected files.  This is not a bug, but rather a consequence
of how the Unix filesystem works.

     <p>The permissions on a file say what can happen to the data
in that file, while the permissions on a directory say what can
happen to the list of files in that directory.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sed -i</span></samp>&rsquo;
will not ever open for writing  a file that is already on disk. 
Rather, it will work on a temporary file that is finally renamed
to the original name: if you rename or delete files, you're actually
modifying the contents of the directory, so the operation depends on
the permissions of the directory, not of the file.  For this same
reason, <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> does not let you use <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> on a writeable file
in a read-only directory, and will break hard or symbolic links when
<samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> is used on such a file.

     <br><dt><code>0a</code> does not work (gives an error)<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b0_007d-address-237"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bGNU_007d-extensions_002c-_0040code_007b0_007d-address-238"></a><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-_0040code_007b0_007d-address-239"></a>
There is no line 0.  0 is a special address that is only used to treat
addresses like <code>0,/</code><var>RE</var><code>/</code> as active when the script starts: if
you write <code>1,/abc/d</code> and the first line includes the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abc</span></samp>&rsquo;,
then that match would be ignored because address ranges must span at least
two lines (barring the end of the file); but what you probably wanted is
to delete every line up to the first one including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abc</span></samp>&rsquo;, and this
is obtained with <code>0,/abc/d</code>.

     <br><dt><code>[a-z]</code> is case insensitive<dd><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-localization_002drelated-240"></a>
You are encountering problems with locales.  POSIX mandates that <code>[a-z]</code>
uses the current locale's collation order &ndash; in C parlance, that means using
<code>strcoll(3)</code> instead of <code>strcmp(3)</code>.  Some locales have a
case-insensitive collation order, others don't.

     <p>Another problem is that <code>[a-z]</code> tries to use collation symbols. 
This only happens if you are on the <acronym>GNU</acronym> system, using
<acronym>GNU</acronym> libc's regular expression matcher instead of compiling the
one supplied with <acronym>GNU</acronym> sed.  In a Danish locale, for example,
the regular expression <code>^[a-z]$</code> matches the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aa</span></samp>&rsquo;,
because this is a single collating symbol that comes after &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;
and before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ll</span></samp>&rsquo; behaves similarly in Spanish
locales, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ij</span></samp>&rsquo; in Dutch locales.

     <p>To work around these problems, which may cause bugs in shell scripts, set
the <samp><span class="env">LC_COLLATE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> environment variables to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>s/.*//</code> does not clear pattern space<dd><a name="index-Non_002dbugs_002c-localization_002drelated-241"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040value_007bSSEDEXT_007d_002c-emptying-pattern-space-242"></a><a name="index-Emptying-pattern-space-243"></a>
This happens if your input stream includes invalid multibyte
sequences.  <span class="sc">posix</span> mandates that such sequences
are <em>not</em> matched by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s/.*//</span></samp>&rsquo; will not clear
pattern space as you would expect.  In fact, there is no way to clear
sed's buffers in the middle of the script in most multibyte locales
(including UTF-8 locales).  For this reason, <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> provides a `z'
command (for `zap') as an extension.

     <p>To work around these problems, which may cause bugs in shell scripts, set
the <samp><span class="env">LC_COLLATE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span></samp> environment variables to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;.
